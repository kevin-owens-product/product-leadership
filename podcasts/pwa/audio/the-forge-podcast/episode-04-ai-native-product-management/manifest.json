Today we're talking about something that affects everyone in product and engineering: how the product management role is changing when AI is no longer a feature you add to a product, but the foundation you build on. Kevin, you've been leading AI transformation at GWI with 20 squads across 4 offices, and you've been developing training programs for PMs and designers on this exact topic. What's changing?",

You write a PRD, engineers implement it, designers make it usable, QA validates it, and you ship it.

In many organizations, the data science team is a separate function that product can \"request\" work from. In an AI-native org, data science capabilities need to be embedded in product squads. Every squad that's building AI-powered features needs direct access to someone who understands model evaluation, prompt engineering, and data pipeline management.",

Use Claude or ChatGPT to do your competitive analysis, to synthesize research, to draft specifications, to prototype features. The best way to understand how AI changes product work is to experience it firsthand.
