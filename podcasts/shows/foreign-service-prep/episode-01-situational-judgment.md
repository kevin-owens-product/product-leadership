### INTRO

**[UPBEAT INTRO MUSIC FADES]**

**MAYA:** Welcome to "The Diplomat's Edge" - the podcast that's going to help you crush the Foreign Service Officer Test. I'm Maya Torres, and I'm right there in the trenches with you, preparing for the FSOT myself.

**JORDAN:** And I'm Jordan Hayes. I spent 18 years in the Foreign Service, serving in embassies from Lagos to Lima, and now I help candidates like Maya - and like you - understand what the State Department is really looking for.

**MAYA:** So Jordan, we're starting with the section that honestly scares me the most - the Situational Judgment Test. Everyone says you can't really study for it, but that doesn't feel right to me.

**JORDAN:** *laughs* That's actually a myth I love busting. You absolutely can prepare for the SJT. You just have to prepare differently than you would for, say, the knowledge sections. You're not memorizing facts - you're learning to think like a diplomat.

**MAYA:** And that's exactly what we're going to do today. By the end of this episode, you'll understand how the SJT works, what the State Department is actually measuring, and how to approach any scenario they throw at you.

**JORDAN:** Let's get into it.

---

### SEGMENT 1: UNDERSTANDING THE SJT (10 minutes)

**MAYA:** Okay, let's start with the basics. What exactly is the Situational Judgment Test?

**JORDAN:** The SJT is one of four sections of the FSOT. You'll face hypothetical workplace scenarios - usually about a dozen of them - and for each scenario, you'll see several possible responses. Your job is to rank these responses from most effective to least effective.

**MAYA:** So it's not multiple choice with one right answer?

**JORDAN:** Exactly. There might be four or five options, and you need to put them in order. This is crucial to understand - the State Department knows that in real diplomacy, there are rarely perfect answers. They want to see your judgment about which approaches are *better* and which are *worse*.

**MAYA:** How is it scored then?

**JORDAN:** Your ranking is compared against an "expert" ranking that was developed by experienced Foreign Service Officers. The closer your ranking matches theirs, the more points you get. You get partial credit for being close - so if you swap two adjacent options, you lose fewer points than if you put the best option last.

**MAYA:** That's actually reassuring. So even if I don't nail it perfectly, I can still do well.

**JORDAN:** Right. And here's the thing - the SJT doesn't have a separate passing score. It's combined with your other sections. So you don't need to be perfect; you need to demonstrate good judgment consistently.

**MAYA:** What kind of scenarios should we expect?

**JORDAN:** They're all workplace scenarios, but they're designed to be relevant to anyone, not just people with government experience. You might see scenarios about working on a team project, handling a difficult colleague, managing competing priorities, or dealing with ethical dilemmas.

**MAYA:** So I won't see scenarios about negotiating with foreign governments?

**JORDAN:** No, and that's intentional. They're testing your underlying judgment and interpersonal skills, not your knowledge of diplomacy. The assumption is that if you have good judgment in general workplace situations, those skills will transfer to diplomatic work once you're trained.

**MAYA:** That makes sense. What else should we know about the format?

**JORDAN:** Each scenario is usually a paragraph or two describing the situation, then four or five response options. You have to drag and drop them into order, from most effective to least effective. There's no penalty for taking your time, but you do have limited time for the whole section, so you can't agonize forever.

### SEGMENT 2: THE 13 DIMENSIONS (15 minutes)

**MAYA:** I've heard there are specific dimensions the State Department is evaluating. Can we break those down?

**JORDAN:** Absolutely. The State Department evaluates candidates on what they call the "13 Dimensions" - these are the core competencies they believe make an effective diplomat. Understanding these is like having a cheat sheet for the SJT.

**MAYA:** Okay, I'm taking notes. Let's go through them.

**JORDAN:** The first three are what I call the "thinking" dimensions. First is **Composure** - can you stay calm under pressure? Diplomatic work involves high-stakes situations, sometimes even dangerous ones. They want people who don't panic, who can think clearly when things go wrong.

**MAYA:** So in a scenario, the panicked or emotional response would rank lower?

**JORDAN:** Usually, yes. Composure doesn't mean being cold or unfeeling - it means being able to manage your emotions so they don't drive your decisions.

**MAYA:** What's next?

**JORDAN:** **Cultural Adaptability**. This is huge for the Foreign Service. Can you work effectively with people from different backgrounds? Are you curious about other perspectives rather than dismissive? Do you recognize that your way isn't the only way?

**MAYA:** I imagine scenarios might involve misunderstandings based on cultural differences?

**JORDAN:** Exactly. And the best responses usually involve seeking to understand rather than assuming or judging. The third thinking dimension is **Experience and Motivation**. This one's a bit different - it's about why you want to join the Foreign Service and whether your background has prepared you.

**MAYA:** How does that show up in scenarios?

**JORDAN:** It might be more subtle - scenarios where understanding the bigger picture of the mission matters, or where you need to connect your work to larger goals. Moving on to what I call the "interpersonal" dimensions - there are five of these.

**MAYA:** Hit me.

**JORDAN:** **Information Integration and Analysis** - can you take complex information, see patterns, and draw sound conclusions? Diplomats deal with ambiguous situations constantly. They need people who can synthesize information from multiple sources and make sense of it.

**MAYA:** So not jumping to conclusions, gathering information first?

**JORDAN:** Exactly. Then there's **Initiative and Leadership**. This is about taking appropriate action, stepping up when needed, but - and this is crucial - also knowing when to defer to others. Leadership in the Foreign Service is often about empowering others, not just directing them.

**MAYA:** That's interesting. So the "take charge immediately" response isn't always best?

**JORDAN:** Right. Context matters enormously. Sometimes leadership means stepping back and letting someone else shine. The next one is **Judgment** - this is the big one, honestly. It's about making sound decisions, especially in ambiguous situations. Weighing pros and cons. Considering consequences.

**MAYA:** This feels like it overlaps with everything else.

**JORDAN:** It does. Judgment is sort of the meta-skill. Then we have **Objectivity and Integrity**. Can you be fair? Can you see multiple sides of an issue? Are you honest, even when it's uncomfortable? The Foreign Service needs people who will tell hard truths, not just what their bosses want to hear.

**MAYA:** I can see how that would be critical in diplomatic work.

**JORDAN:** Absolutely. Integrity is non-negotiable. The last interpersonal dimension is **Oral Communication** - can you express yourself clearly and persuasively? Can you adapt your communication style to your audience? In scenarios, this might show up as choosing the response that involves clear, appropriate communication.

**MAYA:** Okay, that's eight. What are the remaining five?

**JORDAN:** The last five are what I call "work style" dimensions. **Planning and Organizing** - can you manage your time, prioritize tasks, and create effective plans? Diplomats juggle many responsibilities; they need to be organized.

**MAYA:** So scenarios about competing deadlines?

**JORDAN:** Definitely. Then there's **Quantitative Analysis** - this is about comfort with data and numbers. It might seem odd for diplomacy, but a lot of the work involves budgets, statistics, economic indicators. You don't need to be a mathematician, but you can't be afraid of numbers.

**MAYA:** What else?

**JORDAN:** **Resourcefulness** - can you find creative solutions? Can you work effectively even when you don't have everything you need? Diplomats overseas often have to improvise with limited resources. Then **Working with Others** - this is about collaboration, teamwork, building positive relationships. Different from leadership - this is about being a good team member, not necessarily being in charge.

**MAYA:** And the last one?

**JORDAN:** **Written Communication**. Can you write clearly and effectively? This matters enormously in the Foreign Service - cables, reports, briefings. Diplomats write constantly. In SJT scenarios, this might show up as choosing responses that involve appropriate documentation or written follow-up.

**MAYA:** So when I'm looking at a scenario, I should be asking myself which of these dimensions are being tested?

**JORDAN:** Exactly. And often, multiple dimensions are at play. The best responses typically demonstrate several of these competencies together.

### SEGMENT 3: THE DIPLOMATIC MINDSET (10 minutes)

**MAYA:** Before we get to practice scenarios, I want to understand the overall mindset. What makes someone think like a diplomat?

**JORDAN:** Great question. Let me give you what I call the "Five Principles of Diplomatic Thinking." These should guide your approach to every scenario.

**MAYA:** I'm ready.

**JORDAN:** First: **Relationships are assets**. In diplomacy, and in the SJT, the best solutions usually preserve or strengthen relationships. Even when you need to be firm or address a problem, you do it in a way that keeps the door open for future collaboration.

**MAYA:** So burning bridges is always bad?

**JORDAN:** Almost always. There might be rare cases where you need to take a hard stand, but even then, you try to do it respectfully. Think about it - in an embassy, you're going to work with the same people for years. You can't afford to make enemies.

**MAYA:** What's the second principle?

**JORDAN:** **Context matters**. Before choosing a response, always consider the full situation. Who are the stakeholders? What are the potential consequences? What's the organizational culture? The same action might be appropriate in one context and completely wrong in another.

**MAYA:** Can you give an example?

**JORDAN:** Sure. Imagine a scenario where a colleague makes a mistake. Going directly to your supervisor might be appropriate if it's a serious ethical issue, but it might be wrong if it's a minor error that the colleague could easily fix themselves. The context determines the right response.

**MAYA:** That makes sense. What's next?

**JORDAN:** **Seek to understand before acting**. This is huge. Diplomatic responses typically involve gathering information, asking questions, listening. Jumping to conclusions or taking immediate action without understanding the situation is usually ranked lower.

**MAYA:** So "fire first, ask questions later" is not the diplomatic way?

**JORDAN:** *laughs* Definitely not. The fourth principle is **Consider second-order effects**. Don't just think about the immediate outcome - think about what happens next. If you choose this response, what are the downstream consequences? The best diplomats are chess players, thinking several moves ahead.

**MAYA:** I like that analogy.

**JORDAN:** And the fifth principle: **Balance competing values**. In real diplomacy, and in the SJT, you often face situations where doing right by one person means doing wrong by another. The best responses acknowledge this tension and try to find solutions that honor multiple values.

**MAYA:** Can you give an example of that?

**JORDAN:** Imagine a scenario where a colleague asks you to cover for them on something minor - maybe they need to leave early for a family emergency. You value loyalty to your colleague, but you also value honesty and responsibility to your organization. The best response finds a way to help your colleague without compromising your integrity - maybe offering to help them get proper approval rather than just lying for them.

**MAYA:** That's really helpful. It's not about choosing the "nice" answer or the "tough" answer - it's about finding the answer that balances the most values.

**JORDAN:** Exactly. And here's a key insight: the State Department isn't looking for pushovers OR for harsh taskmasters. They want people with good judgment who can navigate complexity.

---

### SEGMENT 4: PRACTICE SCENARIO 1 (8 minutes)

**MAYA:** Okay, I think I'm ready to try some scenarios. Can we walk through one together?

**JORDAN:** Let's do it. Here's a scenario:

*"You are new to a team that has been working on a project for several months. At your first team meeting, you notice that the project plan seems to have a significant flaw that could cause problems later. The team lead, who created the plan, is well-respected and has been with the organization for many years. Other team members don't seem to have noticed the issue or are not mentioning it. What do you do?"*

**MAYA:** Ooh, this is tricky. Let me think about the options. What might they be?

**JORDAN:** Good instinct to think about what options you might see. Typically, you'd see something like:

A) Immediately raise your concern in the meeting to ensure the team can address it.

B) Stay quiet in the meeting, then approach the team lead privately afterward to share your observation.

C) Say nothing for now and wait to see if the issue becomes apparent to others as the project progresses.

D) Email the team lead's supervisor to flag the potential problem.

E) Do your own research first to make sure you're not missing something, then decide how to raise it.

**MAYA:** Okay, let me work through this. Option D - going to the supervisor - feels wrong. I'm new, I'd be going over the team lead's head, it would damage the relationship.

**JORDAN:** Good reasoning. That would likely rank low. What else?

**MAYA:** Option C - staying completely quiet - also seems wrong. If there's a real flaw, letting it continue could hurt the project. That doesn't show initiative or good judgment.

**JORDAN:** Agreed. So you've identified the two that are probably at the bottom. What about the others?

**MAYA:** Option A - raising it in the meeting - shows initiative, but it could embarrass the team lead in front of everyone. That might not preserve the relationship. Option B - going privately - is more respectful, but I'm still new. Maybe I'm wrong about the flaw?

**JORDAN:** You're thinking about this really well. What about Option E?

**MAYA:** Option E - doing research first - that's appealing because I'm acknowledging I might not have all the information. I'm new to the team. But it also delays addressing a potential problem.

**JORDAN:** So how would you rank them?

**MAYA:** I think... E first, because it shows I'm gathering information before acting. Then B, because it's raising the concern but in a respectful way. Then A, because at least I'm speaking up. Then C, then D.

**JORDAN:** That's very close to how this would likely be ranked. You might also see E and B flipped, because some experts might value directness. But your reasoning is sound - you're showing composure, respecting the team lead, but also not ignoring a potential problem.

**MAYA:** The key was thinking about the context - I'm new, the team lead is respected - not just what seems "right" in the abstract.

**JORDAN:** Exactly. Context is everything.

---

### SEGMENT 5: PRACTICE SCENARIO 2 (8 minutes)

**MAYA:** Let's try another one.

**JORDAN:** Here's a scenario that tests a different set of dimensions:

*"You work in a small office where everyone is expected to share common duties like answering phones and greeting visitors. You notice that one of your colleagues consistently finds excuses to avoid these shared duties, leaving others to pick up the slack. Other team members have started to grumble, but no one has addressed the issue directly. What do you do?"*

**MAYA:** This feels like a classic workplace conflict scenario. Let me think about what options we might see.

**JORDAN:** Go ahead - try to predict the options.

**MAYA:** Maybe...

A) Report the colleague to your supervisor for not doing their share.

B) Start tracking when the colleague avoids duties so you have documentation.

C) Have a direct, private conversation with the colleague about what you've observed.

D) Organize a team meeting to discuss how shared duties should be handled.

E) Accept that some people contribute differently and focus on your own work.

**JORDAN:** Those are very realistic options. How would you rank them?

**MAYA:** Option E seems too passive - it doesn't address the problem and others are already grumbling, so it could get worse. Option A jumps right to the supervisor without trying to solve it ourselves. Option B is weirdly passive-aggressive - tracking without talking?

**JORDAN:** Good observations. What about C and D?

**MAYA:** Option C - direct conversation - that's the diplomatic approach, right? Address it privately, give the colleague a chance to explain or change. Option D - the team meeting - could work, but it might embarrass the colleague or turn into a pile-on.

**JORDAN:** So your ranking?

**MAYA:** I'd put C first - direct, private, gives them a chance. Then maybe D - if the direct conversation doesn't work, a team discussion of norms could help. Then A - going to the supervisor is appropriate if other approaches fail. Then B, then E.

**JORDAN:** That's solid reasoning. One thing I'd add - the ranking might put D a bit lower because a team meeting could be seen as avoiding the direct conversation. But your logic about C being first is exactly right.

**MAYA:** What dimensions were being tested here?

**JORDAN:** Great question. Primarily Working with Others - can you handle interpersonal friction? Also Judgment - can you pick the right level of escalation? And Initiative - are you willing to address problems rather than ignore them? But notably, the best answer involves direct communication, not going behind someone's back.

---

### SEGMENT 6: PRACTICE SCENARIO 3 - ETHICS (8 minutes)

**MAYA:** Can we do one that's more of an ethical dilemma? I feel like those are the hardest.

**JORDAN:** You're right - ethical scenarios can be challenging because there's often tension between values. Here's one:

*"You discover that a colleague has been claiming overtime hours that they didn't actually work. The amounts are relatively small, and you know that this colleague is going through a difficult financial situation due to a family illness. You like this colleague and consider them a friend. What do you do?"*

**MAYA:** Ouch. This one hurts.

**JORDAN:** That's the point. Real diplomacy involves hard choices. What are your instincts?

**MAYA:** My gut says you have to report it, but that feels harsh given the circumstances. Let me think about what dimensions are in play here.

**JORDAN:** What do you see?

**MAYA:** Objectivity and Integrity - that's the big one. The colleague is essentially stealing, even if it's a small amount and for sympathetic reasons. But also Working with Others - they're my friend. And Judgment - balancing these competing concerns.

**JORDAN:** What options might you see?

**MAYA:** Maybe:

A) Report the colleague to your supervisor immediately.

B) Talk to the colleague privately and give them a chance to correct it themselves.

C) Look the other way because the amounts are small and the circumstances are sympathetic.

D) Anonymously tip off the accounting department to look into overtime claims.

E) Help the colleague find legitimate resources for their financial difficulties.

**JORDAN:** Those are good options. How would you rank them?

**MAYA:** C is out - looking the other way compromises my integrity. D feels cowardly - if I'm going to report, I should own it. A seems harsh as a first step. E is nice but doesn't address the actual wrongdoing.

**JORDAN:** What about B?

**MAYA:** B gives the colleague a chance to make it right, which feels more humane. But what if they don't? Then what?

**JORDAN:** This is where ranking matters. You might rank B first, but A would be right behind it - because if the direct conversation doesn't lead to correction, reporting becomes necessary.

**MAYA:** So my ranking would be: B first, then A, then E, then D, then C?

**JORDAN:** That's very defensible. You're prioritizing integrity - the wrongdoing has to be addressed - but you're doing it in the most humane way possible. You're giving your friend a chance to make it right before escalating.

**MAYA:** What's the key lesson here?

**JORDAN:** In ethics scenarios, integrity always wins. You can be kind about it, you can give people chances, but you cannot compromise your honesty or look the other way on clear wrongdoing. The State Department needs people who will do the right thing even when it's hard.

**MAYA:** Even if it costs a friendship?

**JORDAN:** Even then. Although in this case, the best response - the private conversation - actually gives the best chance of preserving the friendship while still doing the right thing.

---

### SEGMENT 7: COMMON MISTAKES (8 minutes)

**MAYA:** What are the most common mistakes people make on the SJT?

**JORDAN:** Great question. I see several patterns. First: **Choosing the "hero" response**. Some people always pick the most dramatic, take-charge option. "Immediately confront the person!" "Go straight to the top!" But diplomacy is usually about measured responses, not dramatic ones.

**MAYA:** So if an option sounds like the climax of a movie, it's probably not the best choice?

**JORDAN:** *laughs* That's actually a good rule of thumb. Second mistake: **Ignoring the chain of command**. There's almost always a proper channel for addressing problems. Jumping to the top is rarely the right first step. Work within the system first.

**MAYA:** Unless it's a serious ethics issue?

**JORDAN:** Even then, you usually have a designated process. Third mistake: **Avoiding conflict entirely**. The opposite of the hero problem. Some people rank passive options too high because they seem "nice" or "diplomatic." But diplomats have to address problems. Avoidance isn't diplomacy; it's just avoidance.

**MAYA:** So there's a balance.

**JORDAN:** Exactly. Fourth mistake: **Not considering all stakeholders**. Every scenario has multiple people affected - your colleague, your supervisor, the organization, external parties. The best responses consider everyone, not just the immediate participants.

**MAYA:** Like in the ethics scenario - the organization is being harmed, not just the question of my friendship.

**JORDAN:** Right. Fifth mistake: **Forgetting that you might be wrong**. Responses that gather more information, check assumptions, or allow for the possibility of misunderstanding often rank higher than responses that assume you've got the complete picture.

**MAYA:** That's the "seek to understand" principle.

**JORDAN:** Exactly. And the sixth common mistake: **Over-relying on "rules."** Some people try to create simple rules like "always talk to the person first" or "always go to your supervisor." But the SJT is designed to test nuanced judgment, not rule-following. The right answer depends on the context.

**MAYA:** So I shouldn't look for a formula.

**JORDAN:** The only formula is: read carefully, consider the context, think about the 13 dimensions, and use good judgment. Which, I know, isn't much of a formula.

**MAYA:** *laughs* It's the formula for life, really.

---

### SEGMENT 8: TEST-TAKING STRATEGIES (5 minutes)

**MAYA:** Any practical tips for the actual test?

**JORDAN:** A few. First: **Read the scenario twice**. The first time for the overall situation, the second time for the specific details. Context matters, and missing a detail can lead you astray.

**MAYA:** What else?

**JORDAN:** **Read all the options before ranking**. Don't start ranking until you've seen everything. Sometimes an option seems good until you see a better one, and it's easier to rank correctly if you've seen the full picture.

**MAYA:** That makes sense.

**JORDAN:** **Eliminate extremes first**. In most scenarios, the most extreme options - either the most aggressive or the most passive - will rank near the bottom. Start by identifying those, then focus on ranking the middle options.

**MAYA:** What about time management?

**JORDAN:** The SJT isn't meant to be a speed test, but you do have limited time. Don't agonize too long on any single scenario. If you're stuck, make your best judgment and move on. Your first instinct, after careful reading, is often correct.

**MAYA:** Any mental tricks?

**JORDAN:** Here's one that helps: For each scenario, ask yourself "What would a thoughtful, experienced professional do here?" Not a saint, not a pushover, not a maverick - a thoughtful professional who cares about their work and their colleagues.

**MAYA:** I like that.

**JORDAN:** Also, after you rank the options, do a quick gut-check: "Would I be proud of this response? Would I be comfortable explaining it to a respected mentor?" If something feels off, reconsider.

---

### SEGMENT 9: FINAL PRACTICE AND WRAP-UP (8 minutes)

**MAYA:** Let's do one more scenario, and I'll try to apply everything we've learned.

**JORDAN:** Here's a comprehensive one:

*"You're leading a small team on a time-sensitive project. One team member, Pat, has been underperforming, missing deadlines and producing work with errors. You've had one informal conversation about it, but the issues continue. Other team members are frustrated and you're concerned about meeting the project deadline. Pat recently mentioned personal issues at home but didn't go into detail. What do you do?"*

**MAYA:** Okay, let me work through this out loud. This is testing leadership, judgment, working with others, and probably composure. The dimensions in tension are: achieving the project goal versus being compassionate to Pat.

**JORDAN:** Good start.

**MAYA:** Possible responses might be:

A) Have a formal performance conversation with Pat, documenting the issues and setting clear expectations.

B) Redistribute Pat's work to other team members to ensure the deadline is met.

C) Ask Pat directly if their personal issues are affecting their work and if they need any support.

D) Report Pat's performance issues to your supervisor and ask for guidance.

E) Give Pat more time, since they mentioned personal issues.

**MAYA:** Let me rank these. Option E is too passive - one informal conversation already happened and things haven't improved. I have a responsibility to the team and the project. Option B solves the immediate problem but doesn't address the underlying issue and might embarrass Pat.

**JORDAN:** Keep going.

**MAYA:** Option D - going to the supervisor - isn't wrong, but I should try to handle it myself first. I'm the leader. Option A is formal and clear but doesn't acknowledge the personal issues. Option C tries to understand what's going on before taking action - that's the "seek to understand" principle.

**JORDAN:** So your ranking?

**MAYA:** I'd put C first - it opens the door to understanding what's happening. Then A - because I do need to set clear expectations. Then D - because if my approaches don't work, I should seek guidance. Then B - as a last resort to meet the deadline. Then E.

**JORDAN:** Excellent reasoning. You balanced compassion with responsibility. You prioritized understanding, but you didn't avoid the performance issue. And you showed awareness that you have a team and a project to think about, not just Pat.

**MAYA:** It felt more natural this time. Like I was actually thinking it through instead of guessing.

**JORDAN:** That's exactly what practice does. The more scenarios you work through, the more automatic this kind of thinking becomes.

**MAYA:** So to summarize what we've learned today?

**JORDAN:** The SJT isn't a trick - it's testing real judgment. Understand the 13 dimensions. Apply the five principles of diplomatic thinking. Read carefully, consider context, and look for balanced responses that address problems while preserving relationships.

**MAYA:** And don't be the hero or the pushover.

**JORDAN:** Exactly. Be the thoughtful professional. That's what the State Department is looking for.

**MAYA:** Jordan, this has been incredibly helpful. For everyone listening, we've got five more episodes coming - Foreign Service history, world history and geography, political systems, grammar, and sentence structure.

**JORDAN:** Next time, we'll dive into the fascinating history of America's diplomatic corps. From Benjamin Franklin to today's diverse Foreign Service. You'll learn the key events, the influential figures, and why understanding this history will make you a better diplomat.

**MAYA:** Until then, keep practicing those scenarios. And remember - you've got this.

**JORDAN:** See you next time on The Diplomat's Edge.
