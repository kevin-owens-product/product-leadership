### INTRO (3 minutes)

**ALEX:** Welcome to The Forge Podcast, a deep dive into the intersection of private equity, software transformation, and the AI-native future. I'm Alex, and with me today is Kevin, who's spent the last 25 years in software and product leadership, and is now focused on one of the most interesting and underexplored questions in tech: how do private equity firms actually create value in software companies? Kevin, let's start with the basics. Most people in tech think of PE as the bad guys. They buy companies, cut costs, and flip them. Is that actually what happens?

**KEVIN:** It's a great question, and the honest answer is: sometimes, yes. But the sophisticated PE firms, the ones generating the best returns, have moved way past the cost-cutting playbook. Let me break down how PE value creation actually works, because it's more nuanced than most tech people realize.

There are fundamentally four levers PE firms pull to create value. The first is revenue growth, which is the most valuable but hardest to achieve. The second is margin expansion, which is the classic "operational improvement" play. The third is multiple expansion, meaning you buy the company when the market values it at, say, 8 times revenue, and you sell it when the market values it at 12 times. And the fourth is financial engineering, which is leverage, debt structuring, and capital allocation.

### SEGMENT 1: THE REVENUE GROWTH LEVER (12 minutes)

**ALEX:** Let's go deeper on each of those. Starting with revenue growth. What does that actually look like in a PE-owned software company?

**KEVIN:** So revenue growth in a PE context is different from how a VC-backed startup thinks about growth. PE firms are typically buying companies that are already doing 50 million, 100 million, 500 million in revenue. These aren't early-stage bets. The revenue growth playbook usually involves a few key strategies.

First, there's the buy-and-build or roll-up strategy. You buy a platform company, then bolt on smaller acquisitions that either expand your product surface area or give you access to new geographies or market segments. Medius is a perfect example of this. Marlin Equity acquired Medius back in 2017 when it was primarily a Scandinavian AP automation company. Then they bolted on Wax Digital for procurement, Expensya for expense management, and built it into what they now position as a comprehensive spend management platform. Each acquisition expanded the total addressable market and increased the cross-sell opportunity within the existing customer base.

The second revenue growth lever is pricing optimization. PE firms are ruthless about finding undermonetized products. They'll come in and discover that a company hasn't raised prices in three years, or that they're giving away features that competitors charge for, or that their pricing architecture doesn't scale with customer value. This is where a strong product leader is incredibly valuable to a PE firm, because you need someone who understands value-based pricing and can restructure the pricing model without causing mass churn.

Third is geographic expansion. Many PE-acquired software companies are strong in one region but weak globally. Expanding from EMEA to North America, or from North America to the rest of the world, is a massive growth lever. But it requires product work, not just sales work. You need localization, you need compliance with local regulations, you need market-specific features. In the accounts payable space, for example, every country has different e-invoicing requirements. Brazil has NF-e, Mexico has CFDI, and the EU is rolling out ViDA which will mandate real-time digital reporting across all member states. A product leader who understands these requirements can turn compliance mandates into competitive moats.

### SEGMENT 2: MARGIN EXPANSION AND AI-DRIVEN EFFICIENCY (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** That's a great segue into margin expansion. What does that lever look like?

**KEVIN:** Margin expansion is where PE has historically spent most of its energy, and it's also where the "PE destroys companies" narrative comes from, because the crude version of margin expansion is just cutting headcount and reducing investment.

But the sophisticated version is actually about engineering efficiency and product architecture. Let me give you a concrete example. Many PE-acquired software companies have grown through acquisition, which means they have multiple codebases, multiple tech stacks, often running on different cloud providers or even on-premise infrastructure. The cost of maintaining all of that is enormous. You've got duplicate engineering teams, duplicate QA processes, duplicate DevOps. The integration tax alone can consume 30 to 40 percent of your engineering capacity.

So the smart play is platform consolidation. You move from six repositories to a monorepo, you establish shared services, you standardize on a single deployment pipeline, you reduce the surface area that needs to be maintained. This isn't cost-cutting in the traditional sense. You're not firing engineers. You're freeing them up to build new features instead of maintaining redundant infrastructure.

The other big margin lever is AI-driven automation, and this is where things get really interesting right now. If you can automate significant portions of your product's workflow, you can dramatically improve your gross margins. In AP automation, for example, the difference between a product that requires human intervention on 30 percent of invoices versus one that processes 99 percent touchlessly is the difference between 60 percent gross margins and 85 percent gross margins. That margin expansion flows directly to EBITDA and directly to your exit multiple.

### SEGMENT 3: MULTIPLE EXPANSION AND THE AI NARRATIVE (10 minutes)

**ALEX:** Let's talk about multiple expansion. That seems like the most abstract of the four levers. How do PE firms actually influence their valuation multiples?

**KEVIN:** This is where it gets really strategic, and frankly, this is where most technology leaders don't think enough about how their work translates to value. Your exit multiple is driven by a few key factors: your growth rate, your margin profile, your market position, your competitive moat, and increasingly, your AI story.

Let me walk through how each of these connects to product decisions.

Growth rate is the single biggest driver of multiples. A company growing at 30 percent annually will command a dramatically higher multiple than one growing at 10 percent. This is why PE firms are willing to sacrifice some near-term margin to invest in growth. If spending an extra 10 million on product development accelerates your growth from 15 to 25 percent, the resulting multiple expansion can add hundreds of millions to the exit value.

Market position matters enormously. If you're the category leader, you trade at a premium. Gartner Magic Quadrant positioning, Forrester Wave placement, G2 rankings. These analyst positions directly influence buyer perception and therefore multiples. A product leader who can move the company from the "Niche Players" quadrant to "Leaders" in a Gartner MQ has created tangible enterprise value.

Competitive moat is about defensibility. Buyers pay more for businesses that are hard to displace. In software, moats come from data advantages, network effects, switching costs, and platform lock-in. Every product decision should be evaluated through the lens of "does this deepen our moat or does it create features that a competitor can easily replicate?"

And then there's the AI narrative. Right now, in 2025 and 2026, buyers are paying significant premiums for companies that have credible AI strategies. Not just "we added a chatbot," but genuinely AI-native architectures that create compounding advantages. Multi-agent systems that get smarter with more data, autonomous workflows that reduce the need for human intervention, predictive capabilities that help customers make better decisions. If you can tell a credible AI story at the time of exit, you can add 2 to 4 turns of multiple to your valuation.

**ALEX:** That's a massive number. Let's put some real numbers around this. If a company is doing 200 million in revenue and you add 3 turns of multiple, what does that actually mean?

**KEVIN:** It means you've just added 600 million dollars to the enterprise value. At a 200 million dollar revenue company trading at 8x, you're worth 1.6 billion. Move that to 11x and you're at 2.2 billion. That 600 million delta is almost entirely attributable to perception of quality, growth trajectory, and strategic positioning.

Now here's the part that most technology leaders miss: the work that creates that multiple expansion is the same work that makes the product better. Building an AI-native architecture, creating data moats, establishing market leadership, all of these things make the product genuinely better for customers AND more valuable for a potential buyer. There's no conflict between building a great product and creating PE value. They're the same thing.

### SEGMENT 4: PE ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL AND TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP (7 minutes)

**ALEX:** Let's shift gears and talk about the organizational model. How do PE firms actually structure their technology oversight? What is an operating partner versus a portfolio company CPTO?

**KEVIN:** This is a really important distinction that a lot of people don't understand. There are essentially three layers of technology leadership in a PE context.

The first layer is the PE firm itself, which typically has an Operations Group or Value Creation Team. These are people employed by the PE firm whose job is to support the portfolio companies. They might have functional experts in sales, marketing, finance, and increasingly in technology. The technology person at this level is usually called an Operating Partner or a Technology Partner, and their job is to work across multiple portfolio companies, helping with due diligence on potential acquisitions, supporting technology strategy at existing portfolio companies, and bringing cross-portfolio best practices.

The second layer is the portfolio company C-suite. This is where you have the CPTO, the Chief Product and Technology Officer, or sometimes a separate CTO and CPO. These are the people running the technology and product functions day-to-day at a specific company. They report to the CEO and are accountable to the PE firm's board representatives.

The third layer, which is emerging but not yet widespread, is the portfolio-wide technology practice. This is where someone builds a systematic approach to technology transformation that can be deployed across 10 or 20 or 50 portfolio companies. Think of it like an internal consulting practice within the PE firm, but one that has actual operational authority, not just advisory influence.

### SEGMENT 5: THE FORGE METHOD FRAMEWORK (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** That third model sounds like what you've been developing with the Forge Method. Can you explain how that framework works?

**KEVIN:** Absolutely. The Forge Method is a four-phase framework for transforming software companies from legacy or traditional development practices to AI-native operations. Let me walk through each phase.

Phase one is Discover, which takes two to four weeks. This is where you assess the current state of the company's technology, product, and team. You're looking at the codebase architecture, the development practices, the team structure and capabilities, the product strategy, and the competitive landscape. The key deliverable from Discover is what I call the ARS Score, which stands for AI Readiness Score. This is a quantitative assessment across multiple dimensions that gives you a baseline measurement of how ready the company is for AI-native transformation.

Phase two is Assess, which takes four to six weeks. This is where you go deeper on the findings from Discover and build the transformation roadmap. You're doing detailed codebase analysis using tools like CodeScan, which automatically evaluates code quality, architecture patterns, test coverage, and AI-readiness indicators. You're mapping the team's skills against what's needed for AI-native development. You're identifying the highest-impact transformation opportunities, meaning the places where AI can create the most value fastest. The key deliverable is a prioritized roadmap with clear milestones, resource requirements, and expected business impact.

Phase three is Transform, which is the longest phase at 12 to 26 weeks depending on the scope. This is where you actually execute the transformation. Repository consolidation, establishing shared services, building the AI infrastructure layer, retraining teams on AI-native development practices, launching the first set of AI-powered features. The Transform phase follows a very specific sequence: infrastructure first, then shared services, then agent development, then feature deployment. You can't build AI agents on top of a fragmented, poorly architected codebase. The foundation has to be solid.

Phase four is Accelerate, which is ongoing. Once the transformation is in place, Accelerate is about compounding the gains. You're measuring the impact of the transformation against the original ARS Score, you're expanding AI capabilities to new areas of the product, you're building institutional knowledge so the company can continue evolving without external support. The goal is to leave the company in a self-sustaining state where AI-native practices are embedded in how they work, not dependent on any individual or external consultant.

### SEGMENT 6: THE VALUE CREATION MATH (4 minutes)

**ALEX:** How does this translate to actual financial returns for the PE firm?

**KEVIN:** Let me give you the math with a realistic example. Say a PE firm acquires a B2B SaaS company doing 100 million in ARR with 65 percent gross margins, growing at 12 percent annually, and trading at an 8x revenue multiple. That's an 800 million dollar enterprise value at acquisition.

Over a three to four year hold period, the Forge Method transformation can impact all four value levers simultaneously.

On revenue growth: by building AI-native features that differentiate the product, moving into adjacent markets through intelligent product expansion, and improving win rates against competitors, you can accelerate growth from 12 to 20 percent or higher. Compounded over four years, that takes you from 100 million to roughly 175 million in ARR.

On margin expansion: by consolidating infrastructure, automating manual processes, and improving engineering productivity through AI-assisted development, you can expand gross margins from 65 to 80 percent and EBITDA margins from 20 to 35 percent. That's an extra 15 cents of profit on every dollar of revenue.

On multiple expansion: by establishing market leadership through AI, achieving Gartner Leader status, and building genuine competitive moats, you can push the exit multiple from 8x to 12x or higher, especially if the AI narrative is credible and demonstrated.

Run the numbers: 175 million in ARR at a 12x multiple is a 2.1 billion dollar exit, compared to the 800 million dollar entry. That's a 2.6x return before you even factor in the margin improvement. If the PE firm put in 300 million of equity, they're getting back 750 million or more. That's the kind of return that justifies having a dedicated technology transformation capability.

### SEGMENT 7: COMMON FAILURES IN PE TECHNOLOGY TRANSFORMATION (5 minutes)

**ALEX:** Let's talk about the practical challenges. What goes wrong when PE firms try to do technology transformation?

**KEVIN:** Several things consistently go wrong, and I've seen all of them firsthand.

The first and most common failure is treating technology as a cost center rather than a value driver. PE firms that come in and immediately cut the engineering team by 20 percent to improve margins are destroying their ability to create long-term value. They're optimizing for the current quarter at the expense of the exit. You see this especially with firms that don't have technology expertise in their operating group. They know how to optimize a sales org or a finance function, but they treat engineering like a black box that just needs to be made cheaper.

The second failure is hiring the wrong technology leaders. PE firms often hire CTOs or CPOs who are great operators but lack strategic vision, or conversely, they hire visionaries who can't execute. The ideal profile for a PE-backed CPTO is someone who can simultaneously think about product strategy, engineering execution, team development, and value creation. Someone who can speak the language of the board, translate business requirements into technical architecture, and motivate a team through a multi-year transformation. That's a rare profile.

The third failure is underestimating the complexity of integration. When you do buy-and-build with multiple acquisitions, the technical debt compounds. Every acquisition brings a new codebase, a new tech stack, a new set of engineering practices. If you don't have a deliberate integration strategy, you end up with an unmanageable mess that consumes all your engineering capacity just to keep the lights on.

The fourth failure is moving too slowly on AI. Right now, there is a genuine window of competitive advantage for companies that adopt AI-native practices early. In 18 to 24 months, the table stakes will be much higher. PE firms that wait for the market to prove the value of AI before investing in it will find that their portfolio companies have fallen behind and their exit multiples reflect that.

### SEGMENT 8: ADVICE FOR TECHNOLOGY LEADERS IN PE (5 minutes)

**ALEX:** What's your advice for technology leaders who are considering PE-backed roles?

**KEVIN:** A few things. First, understand the economics. Ask about the fund timeline, the current equity stack, and the exit thesis. If the PE firm acquired the company 7 years ago and is looking to exit in 12 to 18 months, you're walking into a very different situation than if they acquired it last year and are planning a 5-year hold. The timeline determines what kind of impact you can have and what kind of equity upside is realistic.

Second, negotiate hard on equity. The equity is where the real money is in PE-backed roles. Your base salary and bonus are operating expenses. Your equity is an investment that can return multiples if the exit goes well. Push for meaningful equity allocation, monthly vesting rather than annual cliff vesting, and most importantly, single-trigger acceleration on change of control. That means your equity accelerates and vests if the company is sold, regardless of whether you stay with the acquiring company. Without that clause, the PE firm can sell the company and your unvested equity is at the discretion of the buyer.

Third, understand the relationship dynamics. You'll be reporting to the CEO but accountable to the board, which includes the PE firm's partners. These partners are not passive investors. They're going to have opinions about your roadmap, your team, your spend. You need to be comfortable operating in that environment and translating your technical decisions into business language that resonates with financial buyers.

Fourth, don't underestimate the transformation complexity. PE-acquired companies often have years of accumulated technical debt, teams that are demoralized from previous leadership changes, and products that need significant investment to be competitive. You're not joining a well-oiled machine. You're signing up to build one.

**ALEX:** Kevin, this has been an incredibly detailed look at PE value creation. For our listeners, what's the one thing you want them to take away?

**KEVIN:** The biggest insight is that technology leadership in a PE context is fundamentally different from technology leadership in a venture context. In venture, your job is to find product-market fit and grow fast. In PE, your job is to create measurable enterprise value. Every decision you make should be evaluated through the lens of "does this increase the exit value of this company?" And the exciting part is that with AI, the opportunity to create value has never been larger. The PE firms and technology leaders who figure out how to systematically deploy AI-native practices across portfolio companies are going to generate returns that make the traditional cost-cutting playbook look quaint by comparison.

**ALEX:** Kevin, thank you. We'll be back with Episode 2, where we go deep on multi-agent architecture and how to design systems where multiple AI agents work together on complex business problems. See you then.
