**Duration:** ~55 minutes
**Hosts:** Alex (Interviewer) & Kevin (Expert)

---

### INTRO (3 minutes)

**ALEX:** Today we are shifting to go-to-market. How does GTM change when product behavior is adaptive and value delivery is continuous?

**KEVIN:** The old funnel model becomes too coarse. AI-native GTM is a feedback system where product telemetry, revenue actions, and customer outcomes update each other continuously.

---

### SEGMENT 1: From Funnel to Learning Loop (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** What is the core mindset change?

**KEVIN:** Stop thinking in linear stages only. Think in loops: acquire, activate, automate, expand, and refine. Each loop is instrumented with both commercial and product-quality metrics.

---

### SEGMENT 2: The Unified Revenue Graph (9 minutes)

**ALEX:** Explain the data model.

**KEVIN:** Build a shared entity graph connecting account, user role, workflow, autonomy level, trust indicators, and revenue events. This enables decisions like: which accounts are expanding despite low trust, or which high-trust accounts are under-monetized.

---

### SEGMENT 3: AI in Demand and Pipeline Generation (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** Where does AI deliver immediate GTM leverage?

**KEVIN:** Segmentation, personalization, and qualification. But quality gates matter. Use AI to prioritize and draft, then apply human review for high-stakes outreach and enterprise narratives.

---

### SEGMENT 4: AI-Native Sales Execution (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** What changes in sales operations?

**KEVIN:** Discovery gets deeper with workflow-level diagnostics. Demos move from static feature tours to scenario simulations. Forecasting incorporates product adoption signals and trust metrics, not just stage movement.

---

### SEGMENT 5: Customer Success as Outcome Operations (9 minutes)

**ALEX:** How does CS evolve?

**KEVIN:** CS becomes outcome operations. Success managers monitor autonomy gains, intervene on trust regressions, and run optimization reviews. Renewal risk is predicted through behavior signals before sentiment turns negative.

---

### SEGMENT 6: Executive Cadence and Accountability (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** What leadership rhythm is required?

**KEVIN:** Weekly revenue-product review with one dashboard. Monthly segment-level strategy reset. Quarterly packaging and pricing recalibration. Assign one DRI per cross-functional performance gap.

---

### SEGMENT 7: 12-Week Implementation Blueprint (10 minutes)

**ALEX:** Practical first steps?

**KEVIN:** Weeks 1 to 4: establish shared metrics and event schema. Weeks 5 to 8: connect CRM and product telemetry for top segments. Weeks 9 to 12: launch integrated playbooks for activation, expansion, and risk mitigation.

**ALEX:** Final takeaway?

**KEVIN:** In AI-native GTM, the best seller is a fast-learning system, not a heroic individual contributor model.
