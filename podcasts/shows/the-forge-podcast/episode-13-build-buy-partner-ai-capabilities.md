# Episode 13: Build vs Buy vs Partner for AI Capabilities
## "A Decision Framework for Speed, Control, and Strategic Differentiation"

**Duration:** ~55 minutes
**Hosts:** Alex (Interviewer) & Kevin (Expert)

### INTRO (3 minutes)

**ALEX:** One of the most frequent executive debates in AI transformation is build versus buy. But now there is a third path: partner. How should leaders think about this?

**KEVIN:** Build-buy-partner is not a one-time decision. It is a portfolio strategy across capabilities with different strategic importance, risk, and speed requirements.

---

### SEGMENT 1: The Capability Taxonomy (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** Start with a taxonomy.

**KEVIN:** Classify capabilities into four buckets: strategic differentiators, operational enablers, compliance-critical controls, and commodity infrastructure. Differentiators skew build or tightly governed partner models. Commodity layers usually skew buy.

---

### SEGMENT 2: The Five-Dimension Decision Matrix (9 minutes)

**ALEX:** What dimensions should drive the decision?

**KEVIN:** Strategic relevance, time-to-value, total cost of ownership, risk/compliance exposure, and option value. Score each capability and choose model per category, not by ideology.

---

### SEGMENT 3: When to Build (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** What are build indicators?

**KEVIN:** Build when the capability drives unique customer outcomes, requires proprietary workflow intelligence, or creates compounding memory advantages. Build also makes sense when integration depth is a differentiator and vendor abstraction would slow iteration.

---

### SEGMENT 4: When to Buy (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** And buy indicators?

**KEVIN:** Buy when capability is standardizable, margin impact is manageable, and vendor maturity is high. The key is to avoid building commodity plumbing that distracts from strategic surfaces.

---

### SEGMENT 5: When to Partner (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** Where does partnership win?

**KEVIN:** Partner when domain complexity is high and shared roadmap influence can accelerate outcomes. Strong partnerships include co-design rights, transparent SLAs, and clear portability terms.

---

### SEGMENT 6: Contract and Architecture Guardrails (9 minutes)

**ALEX:** What guardrails prevent lock-in mistakes?

**KEVIN:** Require data portability, abstraction boundaries, fallback providers for critical paths, and measurable performance clauses. Architecturally, keep your decision layer and policy layer under your control.

---

### SEGMENT 7: 90-Day Decision Sprint (10 minutes)

**ALEX:** Give us an action plan.

**KEVIN:** Week 1 and 2: capability inventory and scoring. Weeks 3 and 4: options analysis with cost and risk models. Weeks 5 to 8: pilot high-impact choices. Weeks 9 to 12: finalize operating model and contracts.

**ALEX:** Final rule of thumb?

**KEVIN:** Buy speed, build moats, and partner where leverage compounds.
