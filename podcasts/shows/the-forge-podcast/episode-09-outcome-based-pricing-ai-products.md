## "From Seat Licenses to Priced Value Delivery"

**Duration:** ~55 minutes
**Hosts:** Alex (Interviewer) & Kevin (Expert)

### INTRO (3 minutes)

**ALEX:** Pricing is where AI strategy becomes real money. Today we are discussing outcome-based pricing, one of the most misunderstood shifts in AI-native software.

**KEVIN:** Most companies either underprice AI features as add-ons or overpromise outcomes they cannot reliably deliver. Outcome pricing works only when product reliability, trust, and commercial design are tightly integrated.

### SEGMENT 1: Why Seat-Based Models Break (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** Why does traditional seat pricing weaken in AI-native products?

**KEVIN:** Because value is no longer strongly tied to user count. One user with high autonomy can generate more value than fifty users on manual workflows. Seat models become misaligned with realized customer outcomes.

### SEGMENT 2: The Outcome Pricing Ladder (9 minutes)

**ALEX:** What structure should leaders use?

**KEVIN:** A four-level ladder. Level one: capability access pricing for early adoption. Level two: usage-linked pricing tied to automated task volume. Level three: performance-linked pricing tied to validated outcomes. Level four: shared-value pricing where upside is tied to customer economics.

**ALEX:** So companies can phase into outcome pricing rather than forcing a hard switch.

**KEVIN:** Exactly. Maturity-based migration reduces commercial risk.

### SEGMENT 3: Prerequisites Before You Price Outcomes (9 minutes)

**ALEX:** What must be true before selling outcome contracts?

**KEVIN:** Three prerequisites. First, measurable baseline and attribution clarity. Second, stable quality and confidence thresholds. Third, transparent exception policies so both parties know what happens when automation confidence drops.

---

### SEGMENT 4: Packaging and Contract Design (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** What packaging patterns are working?

**KEVIN:** Hybrid structures. A platform fee covers reliability and support. A variable component ties to validated outcomes. Guardrails include floors, caps, and shared definitions of success. Contract language should define data responsibilities, feedback loops, and dispute resolution around measurements.

### SEGMENT 5: Sales Motion and Enablement (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** How does GTM adapt?

**KEVIN:** Sales must shift from feature demos to economic design conversations. Solutions teams need calculators that combine baseline metrics, autonomy assumptions, and confidence-adjusted projections. Customer success must own outcome verification, not just adoption check-ins.

---

### SEGMENT 6: Avoiding Margin Traps (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** Where do companies lose margin?

**KEVIN:** In three places: underestimating exception handling labor, overusing premium models when cheaper tiers suffice, and failing to update thresholds as workflow behavior changes. Outcome pricing without cost governance can increase revenue and destroy gross margin simultaneously.

---

### SEGMENT 7: 6-Month Rollout Plan (10 minutes)

**ALEX:** Give us a practical rollout.

**KEVIN:** Month 1: pick one workflow with measurable baseline. Month 2: align product telemetry with finance and CS data. Month 3: launch pilot contract with explicit thresholds. Months 4 and 5: tune quality and cost routing. Month 6: productize the commercial model with sales enablement and legal templates.

**ALEX:** Bottom line?

**KEVIN:** Outcome pricing is a systems design exercise, not a pricing-page edit.
