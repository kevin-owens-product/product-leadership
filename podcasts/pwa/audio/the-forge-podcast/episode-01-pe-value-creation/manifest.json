I'm Alex, and with me today is Kevin, who's spent the last 25 years in software and product leadership, and is now focused on one of the most interesting and underexplored questions in tech: how do private equity firms actually create value in software companies? Kevin, let's start with the basics. Most people in tech think of PE as the bad guys. They buy companies, cut costs, and flip them. Is that actually what happens?",

PE firms are typically buying companies that are already doing 50 million, 100 million, 500 million in revenue. These aren't early-stage bets. The revenue growth playbook usually involves a few key strategies.",

If the PE firm acquired the company 7 years ago and is looking to exit in 12 to 18 months, you're walking into a very different situation than if they acquired it last year and are planning a 5-year hold. The timeline determines what kind of impact you can have and what kind of equity upside is realistic.",

    "text": "The biggest insight is that technology leadership in a PE context is fundamentally different from technology leadership in a venture context. In venture, your job is to find product-market fit and grow fast. In PE, your job is to create measurable enterprise value. Every decision you make should be evaluated through the lens of \"does this increase the exit value of this company?\" And the exciting part is that with AI, the opportunity to create value has never been larger. The PE firms and technology leaders who figure out how to systematically deploy AI-native practices across portfolio companies are going to generate returns that make the traditional cost-cutting playbook look quaint by comparison.",
