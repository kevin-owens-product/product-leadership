Today we're going deep on one of the most important technical topics in enterprise software right now: multi-agent architecture. Kevin, let's start with the basics.

An agent can read data, call APIs, make decisions, and execute workflows. The leap from a single agent to a multi-agent system is the same conceptual leap as going from a single developer working alone to a coordinated team of specialists.",

What happens is each agent team builds their own bespoke integrations, their own data access patterns, their own memory solutions. Within six months, you have 8 agents that each work individually but can't collaborate, can't share context, and cost 3x more to maintain than they should.",
