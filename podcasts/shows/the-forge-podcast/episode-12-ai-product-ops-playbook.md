# Episode 12: The AI Product Ops Playbook
## "Operating AI Products with Discipline, Speed, and Reliability"

**Duration:** ~55 minutes
**Hosts:** Alex (Interviewer) & Kevin (Expert)

---

### INTRO (3 minutes)

**ALEX:** Product Ops has existed for years, but AI-native products seem to need a different function. What changes?

**KEVIN:** AI Product Ops is not just release coordination. It is the operational nerve center for evals, policy controls, model lifecycle, and incident-to-learning loops.

---

### SEGMENT 1: The Mandate of AI Product Ops (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** What is the mandate in one line?

**KEVIN:** Maximize autonomous value while controlling trust and operational risk through repeatable systems.

---

### SEGMENT 2: Core Rituals and Cadence (9 minutes)

**ALEX:** Which rituals are mandatory?

**KEVIN:** Daily exception triage, weekly model-and-workflow review, biweekly eval calibration, and monthly cross-functional operating retrospective. Each ritual needs explicit owners and decision outputs.

---

### SEGMENT 3: The AI Release Pipeline (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** How is release management different?

**KEVIN:** You release prompts, policies, retrieval configurations, and model routing changes continuously. So the pipeline needs pre-deploy eval gates, blast-radius controls, and rollback automation.

---

### SEGMENT 4: Incident Response and Learning Loops (9 minutes)

**ALEX:** What does high-quality incident handling look like?

**KEVIN:** Rapid containment, clear customer communication, structured root cause analysis across model, data, and workflow layers, then institutionalized fixes with verification tests.

---

### SEGMENT 5: The AI Product Ops Dashboard (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** What belongs on the dashboard?

**KEVIN:** Evals pass rate, confidence-distribution drift, override and escalation trends, cost-to-outcome movement, and time-to-remediation. Keep it tight and actionable.

---

### SEGMENT 6: Team Design and Skills (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** Who should sit on this team?

**KEVIN:** A hybrid group: product operations lead, eval engineer, workflow analyst, and governance partner. Blend technical fluency with operational rigor.

---

### SEGMENT 7: 100-Day Launch Plan (10 minutes)

**ALEX:** What does the first 100 days look like?

**KEVIN:** Days 0 to 30: map workflows and define quality gates. Days 31 to 60: instrument telemetry and launch triage rhythm. Days 61 to 100: run controlled experiments, codify runbooks, and integrate AI Product Ops into executive reviews.

**ALEX:** Final thought?

**KEVIN:** AI Product Ops is how you scale intelligence without scaling chaos.
