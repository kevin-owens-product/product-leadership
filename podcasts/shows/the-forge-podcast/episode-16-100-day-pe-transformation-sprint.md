# Episode 16: The 100-Day PE AI Transformation Sprint
## "A High-Tempo Blueprint for Portfolio Company Value Creation"

**Duration:** ~55 minutes
**Hosts:** Alex (Interviewer) & Kevin (Expert)

---

### INTRO (3 minutes)

**ALEX:** We are ending this arc with a tactical question PE teams ask constantly: what can we realistically achieve in 100 days after acquisition?

**KEVIN:** A lot, if you focus on operating leverage instead of broad ambition. The first 100 days should prove momentum, establish control systems, and create measurable value signals.

---

### SEGMENT 1: Day 0 Readiness and Mobilization (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** What happens before day one?

**KEVIN:** Define executive DRI, secure data and repo access, align on target workflow domains, and set baseline metrics. No baseline means no credible value story at day 100.

---

### SEGMENT 2: Days 1-30 - Discover and Baseline (9 minutes)

**ALEX:** What are the first 30 days focused on?

**KEVIN:** Rapid code and product reconnaissance, ARS-style readiness scoring, workflow opportunity mapping, and risk inventory. Deliver a ranked top-five opportunity list with feasibility and value projections.

---

### SEGMENT 3: Days 31-60 - Build Foundations (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** What foundations are mandatory?

**KEVIN:** Unified telemetry schema, minimum governance controls, one shared executive dashboard, and one stable deployment path for AI workflow changes. Without these, pilots become demos.

---

### SEGMENT 4: Days 61-80 - Launch Quick-Win Workflows (9 minutes)

**ALEX:** What should be launched in this window?

**KEVIN:** Two to three high-impact, low-risk automation workflows with clear customer and margin signals. Pair each launch with trust instrumentation and rollback playbooks.

---

### SEGMENT 5: Days 81-100 - Prove and Scale the System (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** What does success at day 100 look like?

**KEVIN:** Demonstrated autonomy lift, stable trust metrics, measurable cost efficiency improvement, and a validated 12-month roadmap tied to enterprise value creation.

---

### SEGMENT 6: Governance for PE Sponsors and Boards (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** What should sponsors demand in governance?

**KEVIN:** Weekly operating reviews, monthly value readouts, and explicit risk escalation. Board narrative should integrate technical and commercial evidence, not separate workstreams.

---

### SEGMENT 7: Common Failure Modes and Recovery (10 minutes)

**ALEX:** What causes 100-day programs to miss?

**KEVIN:** Scope overload, weak ownership, and missing instrumentation. Recovery requires narrowing to one decisive workflow, reassigning DRI authority, and restoring measurement discipline.

**ALEX:** Final takeaway for operators and sponsors?

**KEVIN:** The first 100 days are not about shipping everything. They are about proving the company can learn and compound faster than competitors.
