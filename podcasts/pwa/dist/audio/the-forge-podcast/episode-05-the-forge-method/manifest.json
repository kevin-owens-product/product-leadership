Over the past four episodes, we've covered PE value creation, multi-agent architecture, platform power dynamics, and AI-native product management. Now we're tying it all together with a deep dive into The Forge Method, which is Kevin's systematic framework for transforming software companies from traditional to AI-native operations. Kevin, give us the elevator pitch. What is the Forge Method and why does it exist?",
