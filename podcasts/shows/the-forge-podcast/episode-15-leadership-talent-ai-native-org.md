# Episode 15: Leadership and Talent in the AI-Native Organization
## "How Roles, Incentives, and Capability Models Must Evolve"

**Duration:** ~55 minutes
**Hosts:** Alex (Interviewer) & Kevin (Expert)

### INTRO (3 minutes)

**ALEX:** We have covered systems and operating models, but transformation succeeds or fails on people. What changes in leadership and talent design?

**KEVIN:** AI-native orgs reward integration capability, fast learning behavior, and high-quality judgment under uncertainty. Title-based authority without cross-domain fluency gets exposed quickly.

---

### SEGMENT 1: The New Leadership Profile (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** What traits define effective AI-native leaders?

**KEVIN:** Systems thinking, technical-commercial fluency, decision velocity, and governance discipline. Leaders must hold product quality, revenue implications, and platform constraints in one mental model.

---

### SEGMENT 2: Role Architecture by Layer (9 minutes)

**ALEX:** How should roles be structured?

**KEVIN:** Three layers. Strategic layer: integrated executive ownership. Operational layer: AI Product Ops, Revenue Engineering, and platform reliability leadership. Execution layer: cross-functional squads with clear decision rights and policy budgets.

---

### SEGMENT 3: Skills and Capability Matrix (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** What capability matrix should companies use?

**KEVIN:** Measure each role against AI literacy, workflow design, data fluency, risk handling, and experimentation discipline. Build targeted upskilling plans instead of generic AI training sessions.

---

### SEGMENT 4: Incentives and Performance Systems (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** Incentives are often misaligned. What's the fix?

**KEVIN:** Use shared system-level metrics: autonomous value delivered, trust retention, and cost efficiency. Keep domain metrics, but make compensation depend partly on cross-functional outcomes.

---

### SEGMENT 5: Hiring and Org Health Signals (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** What hiring signals predict success?

**KEVIN:** Evidence of cross-domain execution, not just domain depth. Look for candidates who have shipped under ambiguity, used telemetry to drive decisions, and collaborated across product-engineering-revenue boundaries.

---

### SEGMENT 6: Change Management and Cultural Adoption (9 minutes)

**ALEX:** How do you drive adoption without burnout?

**KEVIN:** Stage the change. Start with one workflow and one operating rhythm. Celebrate measured wins, publish learning artifacts, and remove low-value legacy processes so people feel net relief, not just added burden.

---

### SEGMENT 7: 6-Month Talent Transformation Plan (10 minutes)

**ALEX:** Close with a practical plan.

**KEVIN:** Month 1: capability baseline and role map. Month 2: leadership alignment and metric reset. Months 3 and 4: targeted upskilling and pilot squads. Months 5 and 6: incentive redesign and role formalization.

**ALEX:** Final message?

**KEVIN:** AI-native transformation is ultimately a leadership operating model upgrade, not a tooling project.
