### INTRO (3 minutes)

## Introduction

**ALEX:** Welcome to the final episode of Claude Code Mastery. I'm Alex, and it's been a journey getting here.

**JAMIE:** I'm Jamie, and wow, we've covered so much. From installation to MCP servers. I feel like a completely different developer than when we started.

**ALEX:** That's the goal. Today we're synthesizing everything into a cohesive workflow. Best practices, productivity tips, and how to keep improving with Claude Code.

---

### SEGMENT 1: THE DAILY WORKFLOW (5 minutes)

## The Daily Workflow

**JAMIE:** Let's start with daily routine. How do you actually use Claude Code day to day?

**ALEX:** I start every coding session by launching Claude Code in my project directory. First thing I do is get oriented. "What did I change yesterday?" or "remind me where I left off."

**JAMIE:** Using Claude as memory.

**ALEX:** Exactly. Then I review my tasks for the day and often ask Claude to help me break them down. "Here's what I need to accomplish. Let's create a plan."

**JAMIE:** Planning with Claude.

**ALEX:** As I work, Claude is my constant companion. Reading code, making edits, running tests. When I finish a logical unit, I ask Claude to commit with a good message.

**JAMIE:** Integrated throughout.

**ALEX:** And at the end of the day, sometimes I ask Claude to summarize what we accomplished. Good for standups and keeping track of progress.

---

### SEGMENT 2: STAYING IN CONTROL (4 minutes)

## Staying in Control

**JAMIE:** With Claude doing so much, how do you stay in control?

**ALEX:** First, always understand what Claude is doing. Don't approve changes you don't understand. If you're confused, ask Claude to explain.

**JAMIE:** No blind approval.

**ALEX:** Second, work incrementally. Small changes, frequent commits. If something goes wrong, you can easily revert.

**JAMIE:** Small steps.

**ALEX:** Third, trust but verify. Run your tests after Claude makes changes. Check the output. Don't assume correctness.

**JAMIE:** Verify results.

**ALEX:** And fourth, know when to do it yourself. Sometimes you know exactly what to type and it's faster to just do it. Claude is a tool, not a replacement for your skills.

**JAMIE:** Still a developer, with better tools.

---

### SEGMENT 3: CODE REVIEW WITH CLAUDE (3 minutes)

## Code Review with Claude

**JAMIE:** How do you use Claude for code review?

**ALEX:** Before I submit a PR, I ask Claude to review my own changes. "Review the changes I've made and point out any issues." It catches things I missed.

**JAMIE:** Self-review with AI.

**ALEX:** For reviewing others' code, I ask Claude to analyze the PR and highlight concerns. Then I do my own review, informed by Claude's analysis.

**JAMIE:** Augmented review, not replaced review.

**ALEX:** Right. Claude might catch technical issues, but you still need human judgment about design choices, maintainability, and fit with the broader system.

---

### SEGMENT 4: LEARNING AND GROWING (4 minutes)

## Learning and Growing

**JAMIE:** How does Claude help you learn?

**ALEX:** When I encounter unfamiliar code or concepts, I ask Claude to explain. "Walk me through how this async iteration works." It's like having a patient tutor.

**JAMIE:** Always available to teach.

**ALEX:** I also use Claude when learning new technologies. "I'm new to GraphQL. Explain the basics and how our project uses it." Personalized learning based on my actual codebase.

**JAMIE:** Contextual learning.

**ALEX:** And when Claude suggests something I don't understand, I always ask why. "Why did you use this pattern instead of the obvious approach?" The explanations teach me.

---

### SEGMENT 5: EFFECTIVE COLLABORATION (3 minutes)

## Effective Collaboration

**JAMIE:** How do you balance Claude and working with human teammates?

**ALEX:** Claude helps me be a better teammate. I can draft PR descriptions with Claude before refining them myself. I can prepare for code reviews by understanding the code first.

**JAMIE:** Preparation assistance.

**ALEX:** When working on shared code, I'm more careful. I make sure Claude's changes align with team conventions, and I document why changes were made.

**JAMIE:** Team awareness.

**ALEX:** And I share what I learn. When Claude shows me a better pattern, I bring it to the team. The whole team can benefit from AI-assisted insights.

---

### SEGMENT 6: DEBUGGING EFFICIENTLY (4 minutes)

## Debugging Efficiently

**JAMIE:** Your best tips for debugging with Claude?

**ALEX:** Start with clear symptom description. The better you describe the problem, the faster Claude can help. Include error messages, reproduction steps, and what you've already tried.

**JAMIE:** Good bug reports for Claude.

**ALEX:** Let Claude investigate before jumping to conclusions. Sometimes the bug isn't where you think. Claude's systematic search can find the real cause.

**JAMIE:** Don't bias the investigation.

**ALEX:** And create a test that reproduces the bug before fixing it. Claude can help write this test. Then fixing becomes verifiable.

**JAMIE:** Test-confirmed fixes.

---

### SEGMENT 7: AVOIDING OVER-RELIANCE (4 minutes)

## Avoiding Over-Reliance

**JAMIE:** Is there a risk of becoming too dependent on Claude?

**ALEX:** It's worth being thoughtful about. Make sure you still understand the fundamentals. When Claude suggests a solution, understand why it works.

**JAMIE:** Keep your skills sharp.

**ALEX:** Occasionally do things the old way. Write code without Claude, debug by reading carefully, commit with hand-written messages. This keeps your skills from atrophying.

**JAMIE:** Practice without the assistant.

**ALEX:** And remember that Claude can be wrong. If something doesn't feel right, trust your instincts. You know your project better than Claude does.

---

### SEGMENT 8: PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY (3 minutes)

## Performance and Efficiency

**JAMIE:** How do you keep Claude Code efficient?

**ALEX:** Long conversations slow down. I use slash clear or slash compact regularly to keep things snappy.

**JAMIE:** Manage conversation length.

**ALEX:** I try to be specific about what I need. Narrow queries get faster responses than broad ones. "Check only the auth module" instead of "search everywhere."

**JAMIE:** Focused requests.

**ALEX:** And I pay attention to what works. When a certain prompting style gets good results, I reuse it. Over time, you develop efficient patterns.

---

### SEGMENT 9: BUILDING TRUST (3 minutes)

## Building Trust

**JAMIE:** How do you build trust with Claude?

**ALEX:** Start conservative. Require approval for everything at first. Review carefully. This builds your understanding of how Claude works.

**JAMIE:** Start cautious.

**ALEX:** As you see Claude succeed, relax restrictions. Allow read operations automatically. Trust more actions. But do this gradually.

**JAMIE:** Earn expanded trust.

**ALEX:** And if Claude makes a mistake, understand why. Was the prompt unclear? Did you give bad context? Learning from mistakes makes future interactions better.

---

### SEGMENT 10: PROJECT ORGANIZATION FOR AI (3 minutes)

## Project Organization for AI

**JAMIE:** Does code organization matter for Claude effectiveness?

**ALEX:** Absolutely. Clear, well-organized code is easier for Claude to understand. Good naming, logical structure, consistent patterns.

**JAMIE:** Good code practices help AI too.

**ALEX:** Documentation matters. Claude reads your comments, your README, your CLAUDE.md. Good documentation makes Claude more effective.

**JAMIE:** Document for humans and AI.

**ALEX:** And keep related code together. If your auth logic is scattered across ten folders, Claude has to work harder. Cohesive organization helps everyone.

---

### SEGMENT 11: FUTURE-PROOFING YOUR SKILLS (3 minutes)

## Future-Proofing Your Skills

**JAMIE:** Where do you see this going? How should we think about the future?

**ALEX:** AI assistance in development is only going to grow. The developers who thrive will be those who learn to collaborate effectively with AI.

**JAMIE:** AI as collaborator.

**ALEX:** Focus on the skills AI can't replace. Understanding user needs, making design decisions, evaluating trade-offs, communicating with stakeholders.

**JAMIE:** Human judgment remains essential.

**ALEX:** Stay curious and adaptable. The tools will evolve. New capabilities will emerge. Keep learning and experimenting.

**JAMIE:** Continuous learning.
