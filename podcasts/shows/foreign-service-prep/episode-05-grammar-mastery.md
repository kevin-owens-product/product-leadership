### INTRO

**[UPBEAT INTRO MUSIC FADES]**

**MAYA:** Welcome back to "The Diplomat's Edge." I'm Maya Torres, and today we're tackling something that might seem less glamorous than geopolitics but is absolutely essential - grammar.

**JORDAN:** I'm Jordan Hayes, and I cannot overstate how important this is. As a diplomat, you will write constantly - cables, reports, briefings, talking points. Your writing represents the United States government. Grammatical errors undermine your credibility.

**MAYA:** The FSOT has an English Expression section specifically testing grammar and usage. What should we expect?

**JORDAN:** You'll see sentences with underlined portions. You need to identify whether there's an error and, if so, which portion contains it. You're not rewriting sentences - you're spotting problems.

**MAYA:** So this is about developing a sharp eye for errors.

**JORDAN:** Exactly. Let's train that eye.

---

### SEGMENT 1: SUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT (12 minutes)

**MAYA:** Let's start with the basics. Subject-verb agreement.

**JORDAN:** The rule is simple: singular subjects take singular verbs; plural subjects take plural verbs. But in practice, the test writers will make it tricky.

**MAYA:** How?

**JORDAN:** By putting words between the subject and verb. Look at this sentence: "The collection of antique maps are valuable." What's wrong?

**MAYA:** Let me think. "Collection" is the subject, right? Not "maps"?

**JORDAN:** Exactly. "Collection" is singular, so it should be "is valuable," not "are valuable." The phrase "of antique maps" is a prepositional phrase that modifies "collection" - it's not the subject.

**MAYA:** So I need to strip away the modifiers to find the real subject.

**JORDAN:** That's the key skill. Here's another: "The report, along with its appendices, were submitted late." What's wrong?

**MAYA:** "Report" is the subject. "Along with its appendices" is just an aside. So it should be "was submitted."

**JORDAN:** Perfect. Phrases like "along with," "together with," "as well as," and "in addition to" don't change the number of the subject. They're not the same as "and."

**MAYA:** What about "and"?

**JORDAN:** "And" usually creates a compound subject that takes a plural verb. "The report and its appendices were submitted." But there's an exception: when two nouns refer to the same thing. "The CEO and founder is speaking today" - if it's one person who is both CEO and founder.

**MAYA:** Tricky. What other agreement issues come up?

**JORDAN:** Indefinite pronouns are common traps. Some are always singular: "each," "every," "everyone," "everybody," "anyone," "anybody," "no one," "nobody," "someone," "somebody," "either," "neither."

**MAYA:** So "Everyone are going" is wrong?

**JORDAN:** Right, it should be "Everyone is going." This trips people up because "everyone" refers to multiple people, but grammatically it's singular.

**MAYA:** What about "none"?

**JORDAN:** "None" is interesting. Traditionally singular, but now often used as plural when referring to countable items. "None of the reports was submitted" is traditional; "None of the reports were submitted" is common in modern usage. For the test, I'd lean toward singular.

**MAYA:** What about "either" and "neither"?

**JORDAN:** When used alone, they're singular. "Either is acceptable." "Neither was approved." But in "either...or" and "neither...nor" constructions, the verb agrees with the closer subject: "Neither the manager nor the employees were happy." "Neither the employees nor the manager was happy."

**MAYA:** The order matters?

**JORDAN:** The order matters for which sounds right, but grammatically you match the closer noun.

**MAYA:** What about collective nouns like "team" or "committee"?

**JORDAN:** In American English, they're usually singular. "The committee has decided." "The team is winning." In British English, they're often plural: "The team are playing well." For the FSOT, use American conventions - singular.

### SEGMENT 2: PRONOUN PROBLEMS (10 minutes)

**MAYA:** Let's talk about pronouns.

**JORDAN:** Pronouns must agree with their antecedents in number and gender. And the antecedent must be clear.

**MAYA:** Give me an example of an agreement error.

**JORDAN:** "Each diplomat must submit their credentials." This is increasingly common in speech, but grammatically, "each" is singular, so traditional grammar says it should be "his or her credentials."

**MAYA:** But isn't "their" used as a singular pronoun now?

**JORDAN:** This is evolving. Singular "they" is widely accepted in informal writing and when the gender is unknown or non-binary. But in formal contexts and on the FSOT, traditional agreement is safer. "Each diplomat must submit his or her credentials" or rephrase: "All diplomats must submit their credentials."

**MAYA:** What about unclear antecedents?

**JORDAN:** Very common error. "When the ambassador met with the foreign minister, he expressed concern." Who expressed concern? The pronoun "he" could refer to either person.

**MAYA:** How do you fix it?

**JORDAN:** Name the person: "When the ambassador met with the foreign minister, the ambassador expressed concern." Or restructure: "The ambassador expressed concern during his meeting with the foreign minister."

**MAYA:** What about pronoun case errors?

**JORDAN:** These show up too. "Between you and I" is wrong - it should be "between you and me." "You and me" are objects of the preposition "between," so you use objective case.

**MAYA:** I hear "between you and I" all the time.

**JORDAN:** It's hypercorrection. People learn that "me" is often wrong ("Me and him went to the store" should be "He and I went"), so they overcorrect. Test yourself by removing the other person: "Between I" sounds wrong; "between me" is correct.

**MAYA:** What about "who" versus "whom"?

**JORDAN:** "Who" is subjective case (like "he"); "whom" is objective case (like "him"). "Who wrote this report?" - "who" is the subject. "To whom should I send this?" - "whom" is the object of "to."

**MAYA:** Is there a trick to remember?

**JORDAN:** The "he/him" test. Rephrase the question as a statement using "he" or "him." If "him" fits, use "whom." "I should send this to him" - so "to whom."

**MAYA:** What about "whoever" and "whomever"?

**JORDAN:** Same logic. "Whoever" is subjective, "whomever" is objective. But here's the trick: look at the whole clause. "Give it to whoever wants it." Even though it follows "to," the subject of "wants it" is "whoever," so it's correct.

---

### SEGMENT 3: TENSE CONSISTENCY (8 minutes)

**MAYA:** What about tense errors?

**JORDAN:** Verb tense should be consistent within a passage unless there's a logical reason to shift. "The ambassador arrived at the meeting and presents his credentials" - that's wrong because it shifts from past to present.

**MAYA:** That seems obvious.

**JORDAN:** It is when it's that clear. The FSOT will be subtler. The issue is often sequence of tenses - making sure past, past perfect, and other tenses relate correctly.

**MAYA:** Explain past perfect.

**JORDAN:** Past perfect ("had done") describes something that happened before another past event. "By the time the summit began, the negotiators had already reached an agreement." The reaching happened before the beginning, so "had reached."

**MAYA:** When do I need past perfect?

**JORDAN:** When you're describing two past events and need to show which happened first. "I realized I left my passport at home" is fine in casual speech, but "I realized I had left my passport" is more precise - the leaving happened before the realizing.

**MAYA:** What about conditional tenses?

**JORDAN:** Common error source. "If I would have known, I would have attended." This is wrong. The correct form is "If I had known, I would have attended." The "if" clause takes past perfect, not "would have."

**MAYA:** That one sounds wrong even when it's right.

**JORDAN:** It's a frequent error in speech. But the pattern is: "If [past perfect], [would have + past participle]." "If she had asked, I would have helped."

**MAYA:** What about present vs. past in reported speech?

**JORDAN:** In formal writing, reported speech usually shifts back in time. "He said that he was ready" (not "is ready"). But if something is still true, present tense is acceptable: "She explained that the Earth is round."

### SEGMENT 4: PARALLELISM (10 minutes)

**MAYA:** Let's talk about parallelism. What is it?

**JORDAN:** Parallelism means using the same grammatical structure for items in a list or comparison. It makes writing clearer and more elegant.

**MAYA:** Give me an example of a parallelism error.

**JORDAN:** "The new policy is efficient, cost-effective, and reduces waste." See the problem?

**MAYA:** The first two are adjectives, but the third is a verb phrase.

**JORDAN:** Exactly. It should be "efficient, cost-effective, and waste-reducing" or restructured: "The new policy is efficient and cost-effective and reduces waste."

**MAYA:** What about longer constructions?

**JORDAN:** The same principle. "The training program includes lectures on history, workshops to develop skills, and case study analysis." The three items have different structures: noun phrase, infinitive phrase, noun phrase. Better: "The training program includes lectures on history, workshops on skills development, and analyses of case studies."

**MAYA:** Is this a common test item?

**JORDAN:** Very common. Look for lists of three or more items and check that they all have the same grammatical form.

**MAYA:** What about comparisons?

**JORDAN:** Comparisons need parallel elements too. "She likes reading more than to write" is wrong. It should be "She likes reading more than writing" or "She likes to read more than to write."

**MAYA:** Both forms compared should match.

**JORDAN:** Right. And make sure comparisons are complete and logical. "The policy in France is different from America" is wrong - you're comparing a policy to a country. It should be "different from the policy in America" or "different from America's."

**MAYA:** What about correlative conjunctions?

**JORDAN:** Correlative conjunctions are pairs that work together: "both...and," "either...or," "neither...nor," "not only...but also," "whether...or." Whatever follows the first must be grammatically parallel to what follows the second.

**MAYA:** Give me an example.

**JORDAN:** "The report not only analyzed the data but also recommendations were made." Wrong. What follows "not only" is a verb phrase; what follows "but also" starts with a noun. Correct: "The report not only analyzed the data but also made recommendations."

**MAYA:** So I look for what comes right after each part of the pair.

**JORDAN:** Exactly. "Both the ambassador and the consul" - two nouns. "Either accept the terms or negotiate further" - two verb phrases. The elements must match.

### SEGMENT 5: MODIFIERS (10 minutes)

**MAYA:** What about modifier problems?

**JORDAN:** Two main issues: dangling modifiers and misplaced modifiers. Both can create confusing or unintentionally funny sentences.

**MAYA:** What's a dangling modifier?

**JORDAN:** A modifier "dangles" when the word it's supposed to modify isn't actually in the sentence, or isn't in the right position. Classic example: "Walking into the room, the painting caught my eye." Who's walking? The painting?

**MAYA:** So "walking into the room" should modify whoever is walking.

**JORDAN:** Right. "Walking into the room, I noticed the painting" - now "I" is right after the modifier and is the one doing the walking.

**MAYA:** These can be tricky to spot.

**JORDAN:** They can. The key is asking: "Who or what is doing the action in the modifier?" and making sure that person or thing appears right after the modifier.

**MAYA:** What about misplaced modifiers?

**JORDAN:** A misplaced modifier is in the sentence but in the wrong place. "The diplomat only speaks French" means she does nothing but speak French - she doesn't write it or read it. "The diplomat speaks only French" means French is the only language she speaks.

**MAYA:** Placement of "only" is a big one.

**JORDAN:** It changes meaning significantly. Put "only" immediately before the word or phrase it modifies. "He only recommended three books" vs. "He recommended only three books."

**MAYA:** Any other common modifier issues?

**JORDAN:** Squinting modifiers - ones that could modify what comes before or after. "Employees who work quickly get promoted" - does "quickly" modify "work" or "get promoted"? Restructure for clarity: "Employees who work at a quick pace get promoted."

**MAYA:** What about phrases like "having been..."?

**JORDAN:** These need to modify the right noun. "Having been revised several times, the committee finally approved the document." Who was revised? The committee? No - the document was revised. Better: "Having been revised several times, the document was finally approved by the committee."

**MAYA:** So the subject of the main clause should be what the opening phrase modifies.

**JORDAN:** That's the rule. When you see a sentence starting with a participial phrase, immediately check that the subject of the main clause is what's doing the action in that phrase.

---

### SEGMENT 6: COMMON USAGE ERRORS (10 minutes)

**MAYA:** What are other common errors on the FSOT?

**JORDAN:** Let's go through some frequent ones. **Affect vs. Effect**: "Affect" is usually a verb; "effect" is usually a noun. "The policy will affect the economy." "The policy will have an effect on the economy."

**MAYA:** Are there exceptions?

**JORDAN:** A few. "Effect" can be a verb meaning "to bring about" - "to effect change." "Affect" as a noun is a psychology term. But 95% of the time, affect is a verb and effect is a noun.

**MAYA:** What else?

**JORDAN:** **Fewer vs. Less**: "Fewer" for countable things; "less" for uncountable things. "Fewer reports" but "less information." "Fewer dollars" but "less money."

**MAYA:** That one I know from grocery stores.

**JORDAN:** *laughs* "10 items or fewer" - they often get it wrong! Next: **Farther vs. Further**. "Farther" for physical distance; "further" for metaphorical extent. "The embassy is farther down the street." "Let's discuss this further."

**MAYA:** Are these tested often?

**JORDAN:** They come up. Here's another: **Lie vs. Lay**. "Lie" means to recline (no object): "I lie down." Past tense: "I lay down yesterday." "Lay" means to put something down (requires an object): "I lay the book on the table." Past tense: "I laid the book on the table."

**MAYA:** This one is confusing because "lay" appears in both.

**JORDAN:** It's the most confused pair in English. "The book is lying on the table" - present tense, no object. "She laid the documents on the desk" - past tense, has an object.

**MAYA:** Any other pairs?

**JORDAN:** **Who vs. That**: Use "who" for people, "that" for things. "The diplomat who wrote the report" not "that wrote." But "the report that was submitted" is correct.

**MAYA:** What about **which vs. that**?

**JORDAN:** For things, "that" introduces essential information (no commas), "which" introduces non-essential information (with commas). "Reports that are late will be rejected" - we're specifying which reports. "The report, which was submitted late, was still accepted" - we're adding extra information about a specific report.

**MAYA:** The comma is the key.

**JORDAN:** Exactly. If you can remove the clause and the sentence still makes sense and has the same meaning, use "which" with commas.

### SEGMENT 7: DOUBLE NEGATIVES AND FAULTY COMPARISONS (5 minutes)

**MAYA:** What about double negatives?

**JORDAN:** In standard English, double negatives are generally wrong. "I don't have no concerns" should be "I don't have any concerns" or "I have no concerns."

**MAYA:** That seems straightforward.

**JORDAN:** The tricky ones are subtler. "Hardly" and "scarcely" are already negative, so "I can't hardly wait" is a double negative - it should be "I can hardly wait."

**MAYA:** I didn't think of those as negatives.

**JORDAN:** They're quasi-negatives. Same with "barely" and "rarely." Don't add "not" or "n't" to them.

**MAYA:** What about comparisons?

**JORDAN:** Several issues. First, compare like things. "The GDP of China is larger than Japan" - wrong, because you're comparing GDP to a country. "The GDP of China is larger than that of Japan."

**MAYA:** Use "that of" to refer back.

**JORDAN:** Right. Also, be complete with comparisons. "The new policy is better" - better than what? In formal writing, complete the comparison: "better than the previous policy."

**MAYA:** What about superlatives?

**JORDAN:** Use comparatives for two things, superlatives for three or more. "Between the two options, this is the better one" - not "best." "Among all the options, this is the best."

### SEGMENT 8: TEST-TAKING STRATEGIES (5 minutes)

**MAYA:** Any specific tips for the English Expression section?

**JORDAN:** Several. First, read the entire sentence before looking at the underlined portions. Understand the whole meaning first.

**MAYA:** Why?

**JORDAN:** Because errors often relate to other parts of the sentence. A verb might be wrong because of a subject that appears much earlier. A pronoun might be unclear because you need to know all the possible antecedents.

**MAYA:** What next?

**JORDAN:** Check each underlined portion systematically. Ask: Is this a subject-verb agreement situation? Is there a pronoun issue? Is there a modifier problem? Go through your checklist.

**MAYA:** And if nothing seems wrong?

**JORDAN:** "No error" is always an option, and it's often correct. Don't second-guess yourself into finding errors that aren't there. If nothing violates the rules we've discussed, choose "no error."

**MAYA:** How much time should I spend?

**JORDAN:** Don't rush, but don't agonize. If you're stuck on a question, mark it and move on. Come back if you have time. Your first instinct is often right.

**MAYA:** Should I practice?

**JORDAN:** Absolutely. Find practice tests - there are FSOT prep resources available. The more sentences you analyze, the faster you'll spot errors.

### CLOSING

**MAYA:** Jordan, this has been incredibly detailed. My head is swimming with rules.

**JORDAN:** That's normal. Grammar mastery takes practice. But you now have the framework. Keep practicing, and these rules will become instinctive.

**MAYA:** Next episode is our last one - sentence structure and style. How to write clearly and effectively.

**JORDAN:** We'll cover everything from sentence variety to wordiness to common style problems. It's the finishing touch on your writing toolkit.

**MAYA:** Thanks for listening, everyone. Until next time, keep practicing those sentences.

**JORDAN:** See you next time on The Diplomat's Edge.
