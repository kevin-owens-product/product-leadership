### INTRO

**[UPBEAT INTRO MUSIC FADES]**

**MAYA:** Welcome to the final episode of "The Diplomat's Edge." I'm Maya Torres, and over these six episodes, we've covered situational judgment, history, geography, politics, and grammar. Today, we bring it all together with sentence structure and style.

**JORDAN:** I'm Jordan Hayes. Grammar is about following rules; style is about making choices. Both matter for the FSOT, and both matter enormously for your career as a diplomat. Today, we'll cover how to write sentences that are clear, effective, and professional.

**MAYA:** This is about the essay portion of the test?

**JORDAN:** Partly, yes. But also about all the writing you'll do throughout your career. Cables, briefings, speeches, reports - good sentence structure and style make you a more effective diplomat.

**MAYA:** Let's finish strong.

### SEGMENT 1: SENTENCE TYPES AND VARIETY (10 minutes)

**MAYA:** Let's start with the basics. What are the different types of sentences?

**JORDAN:** There are four types based on structure. A **simple sentence** has one independent clause - one subject-verb combination that can stand alone. "The ambassador arrived."

**MAYA:** That's clear but kind of dull.

**JORDAN:** Exactly. That's why we need variety. A **compound sentence** joins two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction - and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet. "The ambassador arrived, and the negotiations began."

**MAYA:** Two equal ideas connected.

**JORDAN:** Right. A **complex sentence** has one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. "When the ambassador arrived, the negotiations began." The "when" clause can't stand alone - it depends on the main clause.

**MAYA:** And the fourth type?

**JORDAN:** A **compound-complex sentence** combines both - multiple independent clauses and at least one dependent clause. "When the ambassador arrived, the negotiations began, but the parties remained far apart." You have the "when" dependent clause plus two independent clauses joined by "but."

**MAYA:** Why does variety matter?

**JORDAN:** Variety creates rhythm and maintains reader interest. A string of simple sentences sounds choppy. "The meeting started. The delegates sat down. The chairman spoke." That's monotonous.

**MAYA:** And too many complex sentences?

**JORDAN:** Can be exhausting. Dense, complicated prose is hard to follow. The best writing mixes sentence types and lengths. Short sentences for impact. Longer sentences for explanation and nuance.

**MAYA:** How do I develop this skill?

**JORDAN:** Read good writing and pay attention to rhythm. When you're editing your own work, read it aloud. Does it flow? Do some sentences seem to crash into others? That's a signal to vary your structure.

**MAYA:** What about sentence length?

**JORDAN:** In diplomatic writing, aim for an average of 15-20 words per sentence. But that's an average - you want some shorter (8-10 words) and some longer (25-30) to create variety. Avoid sentences over 35 words unless absolutely necessary.

### SEGMENT 2: CLAUSES AND FRAGMENTS (10 minutes)

**MAYA:** Let's talk about clauses and common errors.

**JORDAN:** An independent clause can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause cannot - it starts with a subordinating word like "because," "when," "although," "if," "that," "which," or "who."

**MAYA:** So a dependent clause is a fragment if it's left alone?

**JORDAN:** Exactly. "Because the summit was postponed." That's a fragment - it makes us wait for something that never comes. It needs to attach to an independent clause: "Tensions increased because the summit was postponed."

**MAYA:** Are fragments ever okay?

**JORDAN:** In very informal writing or for deliberate effect, sometimes. But on the FSOT and in diplomatic writing? No. Complete sentences only.

**MAYA:** How do I spot fragments?

**JORDAN:** Look for sentences that start with subordinating conjunctions (because, although, when, while, if, since, unless) or relative pronouns (which, that, who) without a main clause to attach to. Also watch for "-ing" phrases without a main verb. "The delegates arriving at the conference." That's a fragment - there's no main verb.

**MAYA:** What's the fix?

**JORDAN:** Add a main verb: "The delegates were arriving at the conference." Or attach it to a main clause: "The delegates arriving at the conference represented twelve nations."

**MAYA:** What about run-on sentences?

**JORDAN:** A run-on fuses two independent clauses without proper punctuation. "The meeting ended the delegates left." That's a run-on - technically called a "fused sentence."

**MAYA:** How do you fix it?

**JORDAN:** Several ways. Add a period: "The meeting ended. The delegates left." Add a semicolon: "The meeting ended; the delegates left." Add a comma and conjunction: "The meeting ended, and the delegates left." Or make one clause dependent: "When the meeting ended, the delegates left."

**MAYA:** What about comma splices?

**JORDAN:** A comma splice joins two independent clauses with just a comma - no conjunction. "The meeting ended, the delegates left." Same fixes apply: period, semicolon, comma with conjunction, or subordination.

**MAYA:** Is there ever a time for a semicolon between independent clauses?

**JORDAN:** Yes, when the clauses are closely related and you want to emphasize that connection. "The proposal was rejected; negotiations would have to restart from the beginning." But don't overuse semicolons - they can feel pretentious if overdone.

---

### SEGMENT 3: ELIMINATING WORDINESS (12 minutes)

**MAYA:** Let's talk about style. Wordiness seems like a common problem.

**JORDAN:** It's epidemic in government writing. Bureaucratic prose is famously bloated. But the best diplomatic writers are concise. Every word should earn its place.

**MAYA:** What are the main causes of wordiness?

**JORDAN:** First: **redundant pairs**. "Each and every," "first and foremost," "various and sundry," "null and void." Pick one word, not two that mean the same thing.

**MAYA:** What else?

**JORDAN:** **Empty phrases** that add words without adding meaning. "Due to the fact that" just means "because." "In the event that" means "if." "At this point in time" means "now." "In order to" usually can just be "to."

**MAYA:** Those are everywhere in formal writing.

**JORDAN:** They are, and they're almost always unnecessary. Here's a list of substitutions:

- "Due to the fact that" → "because"
- "In the event that" → "if"
- "At this point in time" → "now"
- "In order to" → "to"
- "With regard to" / "In reference to" → "about"
- "It is important to note that" → just state the important thing
- "The reason is because" → "because" or "the reason is that"
- "There is/are... that" → rephrase to eliminate

**MAYA:** That last one - can you give an example?

**JORDAN:** "There are three issues that need to be addressed." Better: "Three issues need to be addressed." Or even better: "We must address three issues." You eliminate "there are" and "that" and make the sentence more direct.

**MAYA:** What about weak verbs?

**JORDAN:** This is huge. Weak verbs like "is," "are," "was," "were," and "have" often indicate wordiness. "The proposal was rejected by the committee" is passive. "The committee rejected the proposal" is stronger and shorter.

**MAYA:** Is passive voice always wrong?

**JORDAN:** Not always, but it's often weaker. Use active voice as your default. The doer of the action should usually be the subject of the sentence. Passive voice is appropriate when the receiver of action is more important than the doer, or when you don't know or want to conceal who did something.

**MAYA:** Like "Mistakes were made"?

**JORDAN:** *laughs* Classic evasive passive. In diplomatic writing, you sometimes need that ambiguity. But most of the time, active voice is clearer and more powerful.

**MAYA:** What about nominalizations?

**JORDAN:** Great vocabulary word. Nominalization is turning verbs into nouns. "Make a decision" instead of "decide." "Conduct an investigation" instead of "investigate." "Provide assistance" instead of "assist" or "help."

**MAYA:** So use the verb form instead?

**JORDAN:** Usually. "We must make a decision on this matter" → "We must decide this." Shorter, punchier, clearer.

**MAYA:** How much shorter should I try to make things?

**JORDAN:** When editing, ask yourself: "Can I say this in fewer words without losing meaning?" Often the answer is yes. Cut your word count by 10-20% on revision and your writing will almost always improve.

---

### SEGMENT 4: CLARITY AND PRECISION (10 minutes)

**MAYA:** Beyond cutting words, how do I make sentences clearer?

**JORDAN:** Several principles. First: **Put the subject and verb close together**. The subject is who or what the sentence is about; the verb is what they're doing. Don't separate them with lots of modifiers.

**MAYA:** Example?

**JORDAN:** "The ambassador, who had served for fifteen years in various posts throughout Asia and Africa and who was widely respected for her negotiating skills, arrived." By the time we get to "arrived," we've almost forgotten who we're talking about.

**MAYA:** How do you fix it?

**JORDAN:** Move the core statement first: "The ambassador arrived. She had served for fifteen years in various posts throughout Asia and Africa and was widely respected for her negotiating skills." Or: "The veteran ambassador, widely respected for her negotiating skills, arrived after fifteen years in Asia and Africa."

**MAYA:** Keep the main point up front.

**JORDAN:** Exactly. Another principle: **Use concrete language over abstract language**. "The situation requires action" is vague. What situation? What action? "The budget crisis requires cuts" is clearer. "The budget crisis requires a 10% reduction in staff" is clearest.

**MAYA:** Be specific.

**JORDAN:** Yes. Specifics are more credible and more useful. A third principle: **Define terms when necessary**. Jargon and acronyms can confuse readers who aren't specialists.

**MAYA:** Even on the FSOT?

**JORDAN:** The FSOT assumes a general audience. If you use a term that might not be universally understood, briefly explain it. In diplomatic writing, always consider your audience. What do they know? What do they need to know?

**MAYA:** What about sentence emphasis?

**JORDAN:** The most emphatic positions in a sentence are the beginning and the end. Put important information there. The middle is where qualifications and minor details go.

**MAYA:** So "The negotiations failed despite extensive preparation" puts emphasis on failure, but "Despite extensive preparation, the negotiations failed" emphasizes the preparation?

**JORDAN:** Exactly. Both are grammatically correct, but they have different emphasis. Choose based on what you want the reader to remember.

### SEGMENT 5: TONE AND REGISTER (10 minutes)

**MAYA:** Let's talk about tone. What's appropriate for diplomatic writing?

**JORDAN:** Diplomatic writing is formal but not stuffy. You want to sound professional, credible, and clear. Avoid slang, contractions (usually), and overly casual language. But also avoid pompous or bureaucratic language that obscures meaning.

**MAYA:** What about on the FSOT essay?

**JORDAN:** The essay tests whether you can write clear, well-organized prose on a topic. You want a formal academic tone. Use standard English, complete sentences, varied structure. Don't try to be funny or too casual, but don't be so stiff that you sound like a robot.

**MAYA:** How formal is too formal?

**JORDAN:** If you find yourself using lots of Latin phrases, sentences over 40 words, or vocabulary that most educated readers wouldn't know, you've gone too far. The goal is clarity, not showing off.

**MAYA:** What about the word "I"?

**JORDAN:** In essays, "I" is generally acceptable when you're expressing your opinion. "I believe the evidence suggests..." is fine. Avoid overusing it, and don't start too many sentences with "I," but don't tie yourself in knots avoiding it either.

**MAYA:** What words should I avoid?

**JORDAN:** Avoid very informal words: "gonna," "gotta," "kind of," "like" (as filler). Avoid very strong opinions words unless you're prepared to back them up: "obviously," "clearly," "undoubtedly" - these can make weak arguments seem weaker.

**MAYA:** What about hedging language?

**JORDAN:** Hedging - "perhaps," "possibly," "might," "may" - is sometimes appropriate when you're genuinely uncertain. But too much hedging undermines confidence. "This might possibly suggest that there could perhaps be a concern" - that's too hedged. Either commit to the concern or explain the uncertainty.

**MAYA:** How do I develop my ear for appropriate tone?

**JORDAN:** Read quality publications. The Economist, Foreign Affairs, major newspapers. Pay attention to how professional writers handle tone. They're formal but accessible. Clear but nuanced. Confident but not arrogant.

### SEGMENT 6: ESSAY STRUCTURE (10 minutes)

**MAYA:** Let's talk specifically about the FSOT essay. What do readers expect?

**JORDAN:** The essay is timed - you have about 30 minutes to write on an assigned topic. You're being evaluated on your ability to construct a coherent argument, support it with evidence or reasoning, and express it clearly.

**MAYA:** What's the basic structure?

**JORDAN:** Classic five-paragraph essay structure works well. Introduction with thesis, three body paragraphs with supporting points, conclusion. It's not the only structure, but it's reliable under time pressure.

**MAYA:** How long should it be?

**JORDAN:** Aim for 300-500 words. Long enough to develop your argument; short enough to write in the time allowed. Quality matters more than quantity.

**MAYA:** What makes a good introduction?

**JORDAN:** Start by engaging with the prompt - show you understand what's being asked. Then present your thesis - your main argument or position. The thesis should be specific enough to guide the essay but not so narrow that you can't develop it.

**MAYA:** Example?

**JORDAN:** If the prompt asks whether international organizations are effective, don't just say "Yes, they are" or "No, they aren't." A better thesis: "International organizations are most effective when they focus on technical cooperation rather than high-politics security issues, as demonstrated by the success of specialized agencies compared to the Security Council."

**MAYA:** That gives you something to argue.

**JORDAN:** Exactly. It's specific, it's debatable, and it sets up your body paragraphs.

**MAYA:** What about body paragraphs?

**JORDAN:** Each body paragraph should make one main point that supports your thesis. Start with a topic sentence that states the point. Develop it with evidence, examples, or reasoning. End by connecting back to your thesis.

**MAYA:** What counts as evidence?

**JORDAN:** Historical examples, current events, logical reasoning, hypothetical illustrations. You probably won't have time for deep research in a timed essay, but you can draw on your knowledge. "For example, the WHO's eradication of smallpox demonstrates that technical cooperation can achieve remarkable results."

**MAYA:** And conclusions?

**JORDAN:** Don't just repeat your introduction. Synthesize what you've argued. Point to implications. A good conclusion leaves the reader with something to think about. "If policymakers recognize these patterns, they might redirect resources toward specialized cooperation, achieving more through modest goals than through ambitious but unrealistic agendas."

**MAYA:** Any time management tips?

**JORDAN:** Spend 5 minutes planning before you start writing. Outline your thesis and main points. Then write for 20 minutes. Save 5 minutes at the end to review and correct errors. Don't skip the planning or review phases.

---

### SEGMENT 7: COMMON STYLE ERRORS (8 minutes)

**MAYA:** What are the most common style errors you see?

**JORDAN:** First: **Vague thesis statements**. "This essay will discuss..." No - just make your argument. "There are both advantages and disadvantages" - that's not a thesis; that's saying you haven't decided what you think.

**MAYA:** What else?

**JORDAN:** **Lack of transitions**. Paragraphs should connect to each other. Use transitional phrases: "Furthermore," "However," "In contrast," "Similarly," "More importantly." Don't overdo it, but do signal how ideas relate.

**MAYA:** What about paragraph length?

**JORDAN:** Avoid very long paragraphs (more than 8-10 sentences) or very short ones (1-2 sentences). Each paragraph should develop one idea fully. If you're constantly starting new paragraphs, you're not developing your points. If your paragraphs run half a page, you're probably combining multiple ideas.

**MAYA:** Any other common problems?

**JORDAN:** **Starting sentences the same way**. "The UN does this. The UN does that. The UN also does something else." Vary your sentence openings. Use the organization's name once, then "it," "the organization," "this body," etc.

**MAYA:** What about very long sentences?

**JORDAN:** If you can't easily say a sentence in one breath, it's probably too long. Break it up. Especially in a timed essay, simpler sentence structures reduce error risk.

**MAYA:** And clichés?

**JORDAN:** Avoid them. "At the end of the day," "the bottom line," "it goes without saying," "needless to say," "in today's world." These phrases add nothing and signal lazy thinking. Find fresh ways to express your ideas.

### SEGMENT 8: FINAL THOUGHTS AND PREPARATION (10 minutes)

**MAYA:** We've covered so much in these six episodes. Any final advice?

**JORDAN:** Let me summarize key takeaways across all our episodes.

For **Situational Judgment**: Think about the 13 dimensions. Balance competing values. Consider context and consequences. Seek to understand before acting.

For **History**: Know the major turning points and how they shape today's world. Understand the Foreign Service's evolution and values.

For **Geography and Politics**: Have a mental map of the world. Know major organizations and how political systems work. Understand current issues.

For **Grammar**: Master subject-verb agreement, pronoun reference, parallel structure, and modifier placement. These are the most-tested areas.

For **Style**: Be clear, be concise, be organized. Active voice over passive. Specific over vague. Varied sentence structure.

**MAYA:** How should I prepare in the weeks before the test?

**JORDAN:** Practice, practice, practice. Take timed practice tests under realistic conditions. For the essay, write practice essays on random prompts - time yourself strictly.

**MAYA:** Where can I find practice materials?

**JORDAN:** The State Department website has sample questions. There are commercial prep materials available. Practice with any standardized test prep materials for grammar - SAT, ACT, GRE - the principles are the same.

**MAYA:** Any day-of-test advice?

**JORDAN:** Get a good night's sleep. Eat a proper breakfast. Arrive early so you're not stressed. During the test, pace yourself - don't spend too long on any one question. Trust your preparation.

**MAYA:** And if someone doesn't pass the first time?

**JORDAN:** The FSOT has a low pass rate - many strong candidates take it more than once. Each attempt teaches you something. Analyze what went wrong, address those weaknesses, and try again. Persistence is itself a quality the Foreign Service values.

**MAYA:** Jordan, this has been an incredible series. Thank you for sharing your expertise.

**JORDAN:** It's been my pleasure, Maya. To everyone listening: you're preparing to join a noble profession. Diplomats have shaped history and will continue to do so. The work is demanding but deeply meaningful.

**MAYA:** Any final words?

**JORDAN:** Remember why you want to do this. The Foreign Service isn't just a job - it's a calling. Keep that motivation in mind when the studying gets hard. And remember: every diplomat currently serving passed the same test you're preparing for. You can do this.

**MAYA:** Thank you all for listening to "The Diplomat's Edge." Good luck on your FSOT, and maybe we'll see you in the Foreign Service.

**JORDAN:** Good luck. See you on the other side.
