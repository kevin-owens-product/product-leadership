# Episode 6: Frontier Trends and the New Engineering Operating Model
## "Where Agentic Coding Goes Next"

**Duration:** ~55 minutes
**Hosts:** Alex (Practitioner) & Riley (Research Lead)

---

### INTRO (3 minutes)

**ALEX:** We are closing season one by looking ahead. What is next for agentic coding?

**RILEY:** The frontier is moving from isolated agent tasks to integrated engineering operating systems.

---

### SEGMENT 1: Frontier Trends to Watch (9 minutes)

**ALEX:** What trends should technical leaders track now?

**RILEY:** Multi-agent specialization, self-healing workflows, eval-native development pipelines, adaptive tool routing, and tighter integration between planning and execution loops.

---

### SEGMENT 2: The New Team Topology (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** How do orgs change as these systems mature?

**RILEY:** Teams shift from pure implementation capacity to orchestration capacity. New roles emerge around agent operations, eval engineering, and policy governance.

---

### SEGMENT 3: Economic Implications for Engineering (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** What happens to engineering economics?

**RILEY:** Throughput increases, but only if review burden and rework stay controlled. Top teams win by reducing coordination drag, not by maximizing raw generation.

---

### SEGMENT 4: Build Strategy for the Next 12 Months (9 minutes)

**ALEX:** What should leaders prioritize?

**RILEY:** Three bets. One, invest in eval and observability foundation. Two, standardize tool contracts and orchestration patterns. Three, redesign planning and review workflows for agent collaboration.

---

### SEGMENT 5: Risks of Over-Autonomy (8 minutes)

**ALEX:** Where can this go wrong?

**RILEY:** Over-delegation without policy control, knowledge atrophy in teams, and brittle dependence on one model/provider path. Resilience requires human fluency plus system redundancy.

---

### SEGMENT 6: What World-Class Looks Like (9 minutes)

**ALEX:** Describe a world-class agentic engineering org.

**RILEY:** Fast cycle time, low regression rate, transparent decision traces, clear autonomy bands, and strong incident learning loops. Humans focus on architecture, product intent, and risk judgment.

---

### SEGMENT 7: Closing Framework (11 minutes)

**ALEX:** Final framework for listeners building this now?

**RILEY:** Think in three layers. Layer one: trustworthy execution primitives. Layer two: reliable workflow orchestration. Layer three: adaptive operating model with shared metrics and governance. Build in that order.

**ALEX:** Perfect way to close. Final line?

**RILEY:** The future of coding is not humans versus agents. It is high-judgment teams working with disciplined autonomous systems.
